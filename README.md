  - Language: C

- **Turing machine**
  - Description:This code simulates a Turing Machine by reading an initial tape configuration from an input file, processing it with state transitions, and writing the final tape configuration to an output file.

  - Language: C++

- **Movie ranking**
  - Description: This Python script scrapes the top 5 weekly box office rankings from the Daum Movies website and prints each movie's rank, title, release date, and cumulative audience.

  - Language: python
 

- **Plagiarism rate**
  - Description: This Python script calculates and prints the percentage similarity between two text files (such as C, Java, or Python files) using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
  - Link: [Plagiarism rate](https://github.com/justinbrianhwang/computer-science/tree/main/Project/Python_programs/Plagiarism%20rate)
  - Language: python
 
- **User recommended search term program**
  - Description: This Python script reads user-input keywords from a file, increments their count upon input, performs web crawling to retrieve related keywords and sentences containing the keyword, filters and displays words containing the keyword, and saves the updated keyword counts back to the file.
  - Link: [User recommended search term program](https://github.com/justinbrianhwang/computer-science/tree/main/Project/Python_programs/User%20recommended%20search%20term%20program)
  - Language: python

- **Send Mail**
  - Description: This bash script prompts for recipient and sender email addresses, subject, and body, then sends an email using the mail command.
  - Link: [Send mail](https://github.com/justinbrianhwang/computer-science/tree/main/Project/Shell_Program/Send%20mail)
  - Language: shell

- **GitHub Unfollowers Checker**
  - Description: This script checks which GitHub users a specified user is following but who are not following back using the GitHub API.
