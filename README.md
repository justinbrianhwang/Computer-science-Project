## Projects

- **Bus reservation program**
  - Description: This code implements a bus ticket reservation system that allows users to check bus ticket status, make reservations, change reservations, and cancel reservations, with seat information being read from and written to a file.

  - Language: C

- **Turing machine**
  - Description:This code simulates a Turing Machine by reading an initial tape configuration from an input file, processing it with state transitions, and writing the final tape configuration to an output file.

  - Language: C++

- **Movie ranking**
  - Description: This Python script scrapes the top 5 weekly box office rankings from the Daum Movies website and prints each movie's rank, title, release date, and cumulative audience.
  - Link: [Movie ranking](https://github.com/justinbrianhwang/computer-science/tree/main/Project/Python_programs/Movie%20ranking)
  - Language: python
 

- **Plagiarism rate**
  - Description: This Python script calculates and prints the percentage similarity between two text files (such as C, Java, or Python files) using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
  - Link: [Plagiarism rate](https://github.com/justinbrianhwang/computer-science/tree/main/Project/Python_programs/Plagiarism%20rate)
  - Language: python
 
- **User recommended search term program**
  - Description: This Python script reads user-input keywords from a file, increments their count upon input, performs web crawling to retrieve related keywords and sentences containing the keyword, filters and displays words containing the keyword, and saves the updated keyword counts back to the file.
  - Link: [User recommended search term program](https://github.com/justinbrianhwang/computer-science/tree/main/Project/Python_programs/User%20recommended%20search%20term%20program)
  - Language: python

- **Send Mail**
  - Description: This bash script prompts for recipient and sender email addresses, subject, and body, then sends an email using the mail command.
  - Link: [Send mail](https://github.com/justinbrianhwang/computer-science/tree/main/Project/Shell_Program/Send%20mail)
  - Language: shell
