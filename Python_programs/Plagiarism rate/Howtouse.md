This program calculates the textual similarity between two files using Python. It reads the text from two given file paths, converts the texts into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors, and then calculates the cosine similarity between the vectors. The similarity is returned as a percentage. Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Import Libraries**:
    
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
    ```
    
    - This imports the necessary libraries. **`numpy`** supports vector and matrix operations, **`TfidfVectorizer`** converts text data into vectors, and **`cosine_similarity`** calculates the cosine similarity between vectors.
2. **Define Function to Read File**:
    
    ```python
    def read_file(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            return file.read()
    ```
    
    - The **`read_file`** function opens a file at the given file path, reads its contents, and returns the text.
3. **Define Function to Calculate Similarity**:
    
    ```python
    def calculate_similarity(file1, file2):
        # Read text from files
        text1 = read_file(file1)
        text2 = read_file(file2)
    
        # Create a TF-IDF vectorizer
        vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    
        # Convert texts to TF-IDF vectors
        tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([text1, text2])
    
        # Calculate cosine similarity
        cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0:1], tfidf_matrix[1:2])
    
        return cosine_sim[0][0] * 100  # Return similarity as a percentag
    ```
    
    - The **`calculate_similarity`** function reads the texts from two files, converts them into TF-IDF vectors, calculates the cosine similarity between these vectors, and returns the similarity as a percentage.
4. **Set File Paths**:
    
    ```python
    file1 = 'example1.py'   # Can be C, Java, Python files
    file2 = 'example2.py'   # Can be C, Java, Python files
    ```
    
    - Sets the paths for the two files to be compared.
5. **Calculate and Print Similarity**:
    
    ```python
    similarity_percentage = calculate_similarity(file1, file2)
    print(f"Similarity: {similarity_percentage:.2f}%")
    ```
    
    - Calls the **`calculate_similarity`** function to calculate the similarity between the two files and prints the result as a percentage.

This program is useful for quickly evaluating how similar the contents of two text files are, which can be particularly helpful for comparing code files (in C, Java, Python, etc.) or other text documents.
