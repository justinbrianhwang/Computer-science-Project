considered resigning. pickup 4th pvs: `austria is ...' deletes grafs 9-10 pvs: `he again ...' to conform</note>
president kurt waldheim acknowledged thursday that he had considered resigning, and canceled his scheduled speech at the main ceremony on the 50th anniversary of the day adolf hitler annexed austria
he said he would address the nation on television instead. leading politicians have said a speech by waldheim, who concealed his germany army service and has been accused of war crimes, was not the way to lead national reflection on atrocities of the nazi past
the speech on march 11, the day of the nazi ``anschluss'' in 1938, was decided upon last month as a means of avoiding a political showdown over whether to invite the 69-year-old president to address a joint session of parliament on that day
during an interview late thursday on austrian state television, waldheim was asked if he had considered quitting before his term ends in 1992
naturally i thought of it,'' he said. ``otherwise i wouldn`t be a human being. i'd have to be a piece of wood.''
he again rejected the notion of resigning, which has been suggested or demanded from all political quarters
that would only make things worse,'' waldheim said, adding that he has a ``clear conscience'' about his past. he was elected in june 1986 to a six-year term
austria is governed by a coalition of the socialists, led by chancellor franz vranitzky, and the conservative people's party, which backed waldheim for president in the 1986 election. people's party leader alois mock, who is deputy chancellor and foreign minister, is among his fervent supporters
accusations arose during the presidential campaign about waldheim's service as a german army lieutenant in the balkans, and the united states put the former u.n. secretary-general on a ``watch list'' of undesirable aliens last year
in september, at waldheim's request, vranitzky's government appointed an international panel of historians to investigate his wartime activities. it concluded in a report this month that he knew atrocities were being committed in ``close proximity'' to him and did nothing to stop them, and left the question of personal guilt open
in an interview broadcast thursday evening on state radio, waldheim said he felt the president should promote reconciliation, and ``it was a result of this feeling of my duty as federal president that i took this personal initiative'' not to speak
asked whether it was ``painful'' for him to cancel the speech, waldheim responded: ``it wasn't very painful, since i will be present at the ceremony.''
waldheim's office said in a statement earlier thursday: ``in the interest of efforts aimed at a harmonious remembrance ceremony, the president will not speak at this event.'' the statement did not specify a day for the televised address, but mock said later that waldheim would deliver it on march 10, the day before the ceremony
his office said waldheim would attend the unveiling of a plaque honoring members of austria's prewar parliament who were victims of the nazis. the statement added that he hopes to promote the ``peaceful development of our nation.''
leaders of the anti-waldheim movement had said thousands of protesters would mass outside the hofburg palace, former seat of the hapsburg emperors, if waldheim spoke at the anniversary ceremony. it is to be held in the palace, which houses the presidential offices
organizers of the program, including vranitzky, met with waldheim on thursday to discuss his participation. date of burial to sunday and date he died to thursday. no pickup.</note>
former prime minister mamdouh salem died thursday in london while undergoing treatment from an undisclosed illness. he was 70
the state-run middle east news agency said salem would be given a military funeral sunday in cairo
the agency said president hosni mubarak praised salem, saying egypt would remember him for his ``nationalism, his good manners, his self-respect and sacrifices for the majority interest and good.''
salem was prime minister from 1975 to 1978. when then-foreign minister ibrahim kamel resigned in 1978 to protest the signing of the u.s.-sponsored camp david accords between egypt and israel, late president anwar sadat appointed a new government. the peace treaty was signed a year later
salem was a personal aide to sadat and to mubarak, who succeeded sadat in 1981
born in 1918 in the mediterranean port of alexandria, salem was governor of asiut, gharbiya and alexandria from 1967 to 1971, when he was appointed interior minister
a federal judge thursday upheld the national collegiate athletic association's drug-testing program, ruling against a student athlete who contended the taking of urine samples violated her privacy
u.s. district judge walter mcgovern said any violation of privacy is outweighed by the ncaa's interest in protecting students' health, reducing drug use and ensuring fair competition
the american civil liberties union, which filed the suit on behalf of university of washington runner betsy o'halloran and another athlete who later joined the case, will probably appeal, said the aclu's kathleen taylor
under ncaa rules, students must sign a consent form before the regular season begins allowing random testing
the testing does not actually occur until post-season playoff time, but students like ms. o'halloran who refuse to sign are prohibited from regular-season competition
ms. o'halloran, a cross-country and track athlete, had sued the university over its mandatory testing program, but last month uw revised its program so that screening was voluntary and required only of athletes suspected of drug use
the claim against the university was then dismissed, with the claim against the ncaa program and the university's participation in it remaining
however, uw athletes are still required to sign an ncaa consent form
ms. o'halloran had asked mcgovern to grant her a preliminary injunction allowing her to compete for the uw women's track team this spring
but mcgovern denied the request, saying any harm done to her by being barred from competition was outweighed by the potentially greater harm to the ncaa
competent athletes might use banned drugs in violation of ncaa rules, and the public interest in fair competition without the use of drugs would not be served,'' mcgovern said
ms. o'halloran has not been able to compete during the fall cross-country season and will not participate in track this spring because she will not sign the consent form, ms. taylor said
ms. taylor said the aclu was surprised by the decision, especially in light of a feb. 11 federal appeals court decision prohibiting drug testing of railway workers without specific suspicion against a particular individual
the ncaa's laudable goal of reducing drug use among student athletes must be carried out in a less degrading and intrusive manner,'' ms. taylor said
more than president hosni mubarak's efforts to bring peace to the middle east, egyptians are talking these days about shortages of cooking oil and sugar. it's angry talk
cooking oil and sugar are important items on the egyptian menu, used extensively by peasants who make up half the nation's 51 million people
cooking oil is added to beans, which are eaten at breakfast and dinner, and used to fry vegetables, especially eggplant and potatoes, the usual peasant lunch
as for sugar, egyptians consume so much in tea, pastries and candy that the health ministry has begun a television campaign in an effort to persuade people that more than six lumps a day is harmful
the shortages have been assailed in the news media and heatedly discussed in coffee shops
the subject has come up in the shura council, a government body of experts in various fields who give advice to mubarak and to the people's assembly, the national legislature
and in the people's assembly itself, prime minister atef sedki was taken to task because of his cabinet ministers had denied that the shortages exist. sedki admitted they were not being entirely candid, but he assured the assembly that egypt once again will get by
food shortages are nothing new to egypt. the country must import 60 percent of what it eats and it doesn't have the money to pay for all it needs. in addition, it increasingly has more mouths than it can feed, as the population explodes at a rate of 1 million every nine months
that coupled with stagnant food production has transformed the country from the food exporter it was three decades ago to the importer it is today. the nation, facing a foreign debt of $44 billion, doesn't have the money to pay for it all
nobody has a ready solution. increasing food production isn't easy because only about 4 percent of the country's land area, the nile river valley, is fertile, and little money is available to reclaim and cultivate the desert
egypt is among the world's biggest producers of cotton, which is the source of most cooking oil used in the country, but it must import more than 80 percent of its needs _ at a cost of $250 million a year
we import 500,000 tons of cooking oil, at the cost of $500 a ton,'' said rifaat saadawy, an official in charge of oil imports at the industry ministry
so the cooking oil crisis is connected with the foreign exchange crisis, and any shortage in foreign currency means a shortage of providing cooking oil for local consumption.''
similarily, despite expanses of sugar cane in central egypt, the country's farmers produce only about half the nation's needs, forcing imports of 700,000 tons for almost $158 million last year
a further complication is that many stable foods are distributed through expensive subsidy and ration systems. under pressure from the international monetary fund and at the urging of the united states, the government has been trying to reduce the subsidy systems' burden on the national treasury
for the past two years, it has tapered off the number of subsidized items available at government stores or purchased with ration cards from private markets. but the items taken off the list cost much more
despite the cutbacks, the government spent $2.2 billion in the 1986-87 fiscal year on subsidies for food and other items. that's only $675 million less than the subsidy bill in 1983-84 and remains much higher than levels washington and the imf want
the government does not want to eliminate or sharply reduce subsidies because it fears a recurrence of food riots in which more than 70 people were killed in 1977
for peasants like nawal mohamedein, who lives at el-faronia, 30 miles north of cairo, the system is not working
the official price of a one-kilogram (2.2-pound) bottle of oil was 80 piasters (36 cents,) but now it is not available in the shops,'' she said. ``i buy it off the black market for 3.5 pounds ($1.60) a bottle. it has limited our food to next to nothing.''
she said she now has to serve bread and cheese for the midday meal in place of the usual eggplant and potatoes
jazz legend lionel hampton announced that a $20,000 grant the national endowment for the arts is giving to a foundation under his control will be channeled to a music school named in his honor
hampton spoke wednesday to the moscow chamber of commerce while visiting the panhandle college town to headline the university of idaho's jazz festival and receive an honorary degree
i always enjoy coming out here because this is a place where high school students, college students, professional people and educators and jazz musicians can come together in a common cause to listen and improve the great art we foster,'' hampton said
dozens of the world's top jazz performers have come out of hampton's bands. but he said he has gotten the most pleasure from having the university's lionel hampton school of music named after him, which he said is ``like going to heaven.''
hampton started his career in the 1920s. when he joined benny goodman's quartet in 1936, he broke a color barrier that had kept black musicians out of american entertainment's front ranks
wheel of fortune'' host pat sajak says that just because cbs is giving him a talk show opposite nbc's ``tonight show'' doesn't mean he's taking on johnny carson
if you're going to do a late-night show, that's a fact of life, that mr. carson is going to be there. we can't worry about that. we have to worry about doing the best show we can,'' sajak said at a news conference wednesday
cbs entertainment president kim lemasters confirmed plans for the show, which he said would be 90 minutes compared with carson's hour and would debut next january
there is no attempt on our part here to compete with johnny carson,'' lemasters said. ``mr. carson is a tradition, he is much-beloved and a brilliant performer in what he does, and that's not our aim. our aim is that the environment in late night can stand more than just one talk-show format.''
sajak will continue indefinitely as host of the nighttime version of ``wheel of fortune,'' the nation's no. 1 syndicated show. his contract for the nbc daytime version of the show expires in december
rock singer alice cooper returned to his hometown for a weekend concert and mentioned that he also will be running for governor _ on the wild party ticket
more than 80 people already have entered the special may 17 election prompted by a recall petition campaign against impeached gov. evan mecham. cooper, who says he bought his first automobile from mecham's pontiac dealership in nearby glendale, said he will join the throng seeking to unseat the conservative republican
i'm definitely a write-in candidate,'' cooper said wednesday. ``hey, i'm a native. i'm a registered voter. i represent the wild party and i even have a campaign slogan: `alice cooper _ a troubled man for troubled times.'''
cooper, 39, was born vincent furnier, a minister's son. he gained fame with outrageous makeup and such hits as ``school's out.'' his phoenix concert saturday night is scheduled to end the american leg of a year-long comeback tour
hugh hefner's former live-in girlfriend upped the ante in her ``palimony'' suit against the playboy magazine publisher, saying she now wants $35 million to prevent him from ruining other young lives
celebrity divorce lawyer marvin mitchelson filed an amended complaint wednesday for carrie leigh adding fraud and deceit to her previous accusations that hefner abandoned promises to support and father her child
hefner attorney anthony michael glassman said the fraud and deceit claims were unfounded. he called the lawsuit revision a publicity stunt
miss leigh's suit now seeks $20 million in punitive damages ``to dissuade him from maintaining his long-enjoyed practice of seducing teen-age girls, supporting them for a few years and then discarding them.''
the initial complaint filed feb. 11 in superior court sought an estimated $5 million-plus, but the amendment adds the punitive amount and says lost career earnings and benefits amount to $15 million. miss leigh, 24, claims she gave up a modeling career in 1983 to serve as a companion at the playboy mansion to hefner, 61
mitchelson said the relationship ended with the arrival at the mansion of jessica hahn, whose sexual encounter with ptl minister jim bakker led to the evangelist's fall from grace
a pickup truck driver who crashed through the front gate of sean penn's and madonna's home was placed on three years' probation and ordered to pay the couple $3,000 for damages
steven stillbower, 33, of anaheim, pleaded no contest wednesday to misdemeanor counts of vandalism and peeking into the window of the celebrity couple's home
in addition to placing him on probation and ordering restitution to actor penn and his pop singer wife, municipal court judge lawrence mira fined stillbower $2,000
after stillbower crashed his pickup truck jan. 7, penn placed him under citizen's arrest. state law permits a person to make a citizen's arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence
the government's ban on political activity by opposition organizations was the most extensive crackdown in 10 years. here is a chronology of previous efforts to restrict political opposition:

laszlo g. versenyi, a williams college philosophy professor called ``a reincarnation of socrates'' by secretary of education william bennett, died tuesday of cancer at age 59
versenyi began teaching at williams in 1958 and received numerous academic awards, including a senior fellowship from the national endowment for the humanities in 1970 and grants from the american council of learned societies
he wrote numerous articles and four books on philosophy and ancient greek thought, and used the socratic method of questioning and logic in his freshman classes. in addition to greek philosophy, versenyi also taught courses on 20th century german existentialist martin heidegger
charles l. banks, a retired marine brigadier general and winner of medals of valor in two wars, died monday of cancer. he was 73
banks became a marine corps officer after graduating from the virginia military institute in 1936 and fought with edson's raiders on guadalcanal early in world war ii. he received the navy cross for his actions in the marine breakout at chosin reservoir in korea. upon his 1959 retirement banks also received two legions of merit and the silver star. rockies</head>
a quake stronger than the oct. 1 temblor that caused severe damage in los angeles is likely to occur east of the rockies in the next two decades, so buildings in the area should be fortified, experts said
the prediction is based on the history and geology of the region, said robert ketter, director of the national center for earthquake engineering research at the state university of new york at buffalo
the california quake, which killed eight people and measured 5.9 on the richter scale, left an estimated $358 million in destruction in the los angeles area, damaging more than 10,400 buildings and leaving about 2,200 people homeless
i feel comfortable there will be a magnitude of 6 or higher within the next 20 years'' somewhere in the united states east of the rocky mountain foothills, said ketter
ketter, who called the california quake relatively modest, spoke wednesday during a break in a conference on earthquake hazards and construction design in the united states east of the rockies
despite the low probability of a serious quake in any one place east of the rockies, the region's relatively dense population and older buildings make for a ``very serious problem'' in risk from earthquakes, he said
robert whitman, a civil engineering professor at the massachusetts institute of technology, called ketter's prediction reasonable
the last major quake east of the rockies struck charleston, s.c., in 1886, reaching an estimated richter reading of 7 and making itself felt as far away as chicago, conference organizers say. other damaging quakes hit new york city in 1884, anna, ohio, in 1937, western tennessee in 1843 and giles county, va., in 1897
the most severe earthquakes in the nation's history struck new madrid, mo., in 1811 and 1812, ketter said. having an estimated magnitude of 8.3 to 8.5 on the richter scale, the quakes were strong enough to ring church bells in washington, d.c., ketter said
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs
an earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. a 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage
the san francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the richter scale
earthquakes east of the rockies result from pressure exerted by the floor of the atlantic ocean acting on geological areas of weakness, speakers at the conference said. because of geology, ketter said, an earthquake of a given strength can shake an area 100 times larger in this region than on the west coast
we cannot rule out the possibility of a very large earthquake occuring practically anywhere'' in the region, said whitman, who called on architects and engineers to encourage earthquake-resistant construction
cities and states should adopt the earthquake provisions of model building codes, he said. studies suggest that quake-resistant designs add only about 1 percent to the cost of most new buildings, he said
the more important challenge is what should be done to make existing buildings more quake-resistant, he said. while it would be politically difficult to require upgrading to meet the standards of new construction, he said, steps short of that would be acceptable
substantial upgradings of masonry buildings have been done for $5 to $6 per square foot in los angeles and $5 to $10 per square foot elsewhere, he said. for buildings with other types of construction, upgrading can cost $10 to $20 per square foot, he said
the conference is sponsored by ketter's institute and the new york academy of sciences, and co-sponsored by the national science foundation and the earthquake engineering research institute, a professional society for earthquake engineering
robert packwood, u.s. senator and fugitive from a quorum call, thought he was safe, hiding behind a locked door in his senate office
but henry giugni, senate sergeant-at-arms and former vice and motorcycle cop, knew he would get his man
i had to take him in,'' he explained
i thoughti was safe,'' packwood recalled. ``but it's the little things that trip you up.''
it was as unlikely a scene _ and a night _ as could be recalled by senate historians, parliamentarians and press corps observers
it was the night, as sen. john kerry, d-mass., put it, where ``the entire republican party in the united states senate ... vanished into the night.''
it was the night senate majority leader robert byrd, d-w.va., wanted to keep the senate in session through dawn's early light to draw attention to a republican filibuster that previously had been quietly played out during daytime hours off and on over many months
if the republicans didn't want a vote on a campaign finance bill, they would have to keep talking. republicans didn't want to keep talking, so they attempted to keep a quorum off the senate floor, forcing the senate to quit for the night
they huddled in the cloakroom outside the chamber
then byrd got tough. he asked for a vote directing the sergeant-at-arms to ``reques attendance of absent senators.''
the republicans were so requested
but they stayed behind the cloakroom door
byrd upped the ante
he asked that the senate approve a motion to instruct the sergeant-at-arms to ``arrest the absent senators and bring them to the chamber.''
with 45 democratic votes, the motion carried
and the chase was on
kerry said the sergeant-at-arms' orders resulted in ``a lot of senators running off into the corridors at night,'' chased by giugni and a team of five plainclothes detectives
giugni spotted idaho republicans steve symms and james mcclure down in a basement corridor where symms has a ``hideaway'' office
at about the same moment, symms and mcclure spotted the sergeant-at-arms
we took off. henry was alone,'' symms said. he fled down the corridor
i didn't want to be the first one caught,'' he said
mcclure's press secretary, h.d. palmer, said his boss ``blew out of there. he was a fugitive from bobby byrd's chain gang.''
giugni's position was a tough one. he works for the senators in a capitol where senators' wishes are law. ``i had to do my job ... i had a list. i went into the hideaways, then the russell building'' where some senators have their offices
giugni got lucky
packwood had just holed up in his office. ``i thought i was safe, i had been forewarned by my staff that henry was going around looking,'' packwood recalled. after all, he was locked behind a bolted door, and senators locked behind bolted doors in their well-guarded office buildings are usually very, very safe
packwood forgot the cleaning lady had seen him enter his office
and giugni, five years on the honolulu police force under his ample belt, remembered to ask
moments later, giugni and his gang of five, armed with a passkey, threw themselves at another door as the oregon senator was trying to slam and bolt it shut
there were three of them on one side. their mass beat my mass,'' packwood said
giugni was diplomatic. ``it was a misunderstanding. i thought we were helping him open the door,'' he later joked, packwood at his side
the senator was hauled out of his office, across the capitol, put in an elevator, and, finally, physically picked up and deposited feet first into the senate chamber
once there, giugni had his man and the senate had its reluctant quorum of 51 senators
the arrest warrant carried with it indignities, but no penalties
but packwood wasn't taking any chances
i'm asking gerald ford for a pardon.''
the chairman of president reagan's aids commission is drawing praise from one of the administration's more vocal congressional critics for his first round of recommendations on combating the deadly disease
the praise came after retired navy adm. james d. watkins, promoted to the helm of the struggling commission last september, said wednesday the federal government should spend an additional $1 billion a year to fight aids among intravenous drug abusers alone
approval of such an ambitious undertaking would virtually double the $1.3 billion reagan has requested for all public health service spending on aids in fiscal 1989 _ including research and prevention measures aimed at the entire population
admiral watkins has compiled a first-rate set of recommendations that begin to deal with the aids epidemic responsibly and in detail,'' said rep. henry a. waxman, d-calif., who has been frequent critic of the administration during his health subcommittee's 19 hearings on aids
i hope that president reagan will attend to these recommendations of his commission and will amend his budget and come to the congress to support them and the spending they require,''' said waxman
watkins, who said he was making his recommendations to the full commission public at the same time he sent them to the white house, acknowledged that his call for sharply higher federal spending might be less than well received at the office of management and budget
but he said there is no doubt aids is spreading most rapidly among the nation's estimated 1.3 million intravenous drug abusers, and their sexual partners, and that efforts to stem the disease must concentrate on them
he expessed confidence the commission will adopt his recommendations _ which also call on state and local governments to increase their drug program spending by about $1 billion a year _ and formally pass them to the white house in early march
it is not in our charter to worry about the political impact,'' said watkins
a final report is due at the white house june 24 and watkins promised it will get into such controversial areas as aids testing. the panel would be ``at loggerheads with ourselves'' if it tried to deal with them without further testimony and deliberation, he said
watkins also made a number of recommendations in the health care area, including more training for doctors and federal backing for home care for dying aids patients who may not require full-time hospitalization
many physicians are severely lacking in knowledge about aids and there are signs that medical schools have not yet built up a curriculum to educate doctors about aids treatment,'' watkins said
he also cited a growing nursing shortage, saying an additional 500,000 nurses will be needed throughout the health care system by 1991
the report called for more financial support for the food and drug administration as well
asked his reaction to the possibility of presidential candidates, particularly democrats, using his recommendations to ``zing the white house'' for not doing more earlier, watkins replied:
how do you avoid politicizing something in an election year? if they all adopt this and say `let's get on with it,' that's the kind of politicization i like.''

note: no timely results are available from the washington democratic precinct caucuses
in 1988 as in 1980, it is proving difficult to keep the plight of american hostages abroad from becoming an issue in the presidential campaign
president reagan's spokesman has rebuked democratic hopeful michael dukakis for bringing it up, but the record shows that reagan was not shy about criticizing jimmy carter on the same issue in his own campaign eight years ago
the matter cropped up again wednesday when republican aspirant pat robertson said his christian broadcasting network once knew the whereabouts of american hostages in lebanon ``and they could have been freed.''
reagan, in the nearest thing yet to a rebuke of any of the gop hopefuls, asked at his news conference wednesday night, ``isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?''
if he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself,'' the president said
two days earlier massachusetts gov. dukakis was criticized by reagan spokesman marlin fitzwater for bringing the issue up while talking to reporters after a governors' meeting at the white house
dukakis said the administration needed a ``much tougher anti-terrorism policy.'' he said, ``you can never, ever, make concessions to terrorists. that's what we did in 1985 (in the iran arms sale initiative) and it hurt us very badly.''
said fitzwater: ``it's very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you're talking about specific episodes. as we have learned, as indeed the nation has learned, in the last several years of experience, there are any number of aspects to individual hostage-takings that can be exacerbated by political talk or media talk or political statements. i would simply urge caution on everyone's part, including political candidates.''
on jan. 7, 1980, however, while campaigning for the gop presidential nomination in the new hampshire primary, reagan said carter's response to the taking of american hostages in iran was ``too sluggish.''
i believe it's appropriate to suggest that anything that has been done by the administration so far, could have, should have, been done in the first hour,'' reagan said. he said the united states should have ordered an economic boycott and set a deadline beyond which the boycotted country could not go without serious harm to itself
and on oct. 28, 1980, only a few days before the election, reagan said in a debate with carter in cleveland that it was ``high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism. there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind.''
when asked what specific ideas he had, however, reagan said only that he did have some but did not want to inject them into the campaign for fear of endangering the hostages. he said there should be a congressional investigation after the hostages were released
on the weekend before election day, after receiving iranian proposals that he said appeared to ``offer a positive basis'' for a solution, carter canceled campaign appearances and flew back to washington. ``we are within two days of an important national election,'' he said. ``let me assure you that my decisions on this crucial matter will not be affected by the calendar.''
earlier, however, carter had aroused skepticism about his motives when he made an announcement regarding another abortive iranian overture on the morning of his crucial wisconsin primary battle against sen. edward m. kennedy
in the end, the hostages were released on inauguration day in january, 1981, and reagan, by agreement with carter, made no mention of it in his inaugural address because the plane carrying them to freedom had not yet cleared iranian air space
politics aside, reagan's desire to get the hostages out of lebanon, like carter's dedication to freeing the hostages from iran, is clearly an overriding concern
in words that echoed many of his previous statements _ and for that matter some of carter's _ the president said wednesday night that ``it's very frustrating to try and establish a location, knowing of course that you are governed by the fact that unwise action on our part could bring about harm to the hostages. but we've never let up, and we never will, in trying to obtain the freedom of all the hostages.''

the government's crackdown on militant black political groups is intended to reassure ultraconservative whites and convince blacks that tough opposition tactics will not work
the government on wednesday banned political activity by 18 opposition groups, including south africa's largest anti-apartheid organization and its biggest union federation. it was the most sweeping crackdown in a decade
organizations affected by the ban have been unwavering in their rejection of president p.w. botha's efforts to install cooperative black local officials and to draw moderate blacks into power-sharing negotiations aimed at preserving white political power
now the groups cannot, for example, campaign for black-majority rule or organize a boycott of black municipal elections planned for october
every single peaceful action we can take has now been criminalized,'' said the rev. allan boesak, a co-founder of the united democratic front, a coalition of more than 600 groups
the front, with more than 2 million members the largest black political organization, and 16 other groups are forbidden from any activity except bookkeeping and court action
boesak said the restrictions were part of a bid ``to lure a certain section of the black community into the government camp'' before the municipal elections
he said the government ``wanted to create conditions in which, with no boycott, it would appear that its plans and its candidates had generally been accepted.''
by imposing the regulations a week before two parliamentary by-elections, botha also appeared to be trying to blunt criticism from the extreme-right conservative party
the conservatives are favored to win both contests over candidates from botha's national party and have campaigned on a platform accusing the government of caving in to black pressure
on wednesday, the conservatives complained that the restrictions, which anti-apartheid groups termed a ``declaration of war,'' were not enough
the restrictions follow a series of tough government statements and actions against politically hostile neighboring countries. among those actions are south africa's military intervention in the angolan civil war and threats of ``hot pursuit'' raids into zimbabwe against guerrillas who cross the border to stage attacks in south africa
anglican archbishop desmond tutu on wednesday said the regulations were ``a vicious and provocative act by a government which has become a serious threat to southern africa.''
where do we go from here?'' asked the black sash civil rights group in a statement. ``into absolute totalitarianism, with the government and its right wing competing for the spoils.''
if the ban proves effective, the ranks of opposition groups could be thinned drastically. among the survivors, for the moment, are white-led groups such as the black sash and church-related groups such as the south african council of churches
the government's orders allow the militant congress of south african trade unions, the main black labor federation, to remain in operation but bar it from political activity. the general-secretary of the congress, jay naidoo, said the regulations, plus pending legislation to curtail strikes, would be tantamount to an outright ban of the group's existence
inkatha, with 1.5 million members the second-largest black political group after the united democratic front, was not affected by the new regulations. the president of the organization, zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi, considers himself a foe of apartheid but opposes the militant strategies espoused by the front
more than 400 people have been killed in the past year in a power struggle between the front and inkatha in natal province. several united democratic front leaders involved in efforts to begin peace talks were served with notices wednesday barring them from further work with their organization
a.s. chetty, one of those front officials, said: ``it definitely puts the peace process in the doldrums.''
buthelezi had no immediate comment on the restrictions, which may neutralize the front, its archrival, but may also suggest to some blacks that the government doesn't view him as a threat
under south africa's system of apartheid, the country's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs, and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools and districts
david crary, news editor for the associated press in johannesburg, has been reporting from africa since 1985
attorney general edwin meese iii supported a plan to make secret payments from the pentagon budget to israel to protect a $1 billion iraqi pipeline project being promoted by his longtime friend e. robert wallach, according to memos outlined in a published report today
the washington post reported that it had obtained memos written by wallach outlining the plan devised in late 1985 after other attempts to ensure the safety of the pipeline project had failed. the wallach memos say that meese supported the plan and that the late cia director william casey endorsed it
the idea was it was to come out of the defense budget on an installment basis,'' the post quoted one informed source as saying. ``it was, effectively, to be a payment to the israelis to be good'' and not bomb or otherwise damage the iraqi pipeline
former national security adviser william p. clark characterized the plan as ``a protection racket'' when he was consulted about it late in 1985, the post said. on clark's recommendation, newly installed national security adviser john poindexter reportedly blocked the plan, the post said
meese's involvement with the pipeline project is the subject of a criminal investigation by independent counsel james mckay
responding to the latest disclosures, one of meese's lawyers rejected suggestions that the attorney general had endorsed a pentagon payout plan
it's ridiculous. the whole thing is ridiculous,'' james rocap said. ``this is a pipe dream, not only of bob wallach, but of the press. we have a lot of people who don't like mr. meese.''
president reagan's personal approval would have been required for pentagon payments to have been made, but reagan apparently was never told of the proposal, the post reported
reagan told a news conference wednesday night that he knows little of any aspect of the pipeline project
i have no recall of knowing anything about this pipeline plan until fairly recently,'' reagan said. if ``i was given information earlier ... i have totally forgotten it. i have no knowledge of anything of that kind.''
wallach, a lawyer, had been hired to promote the pipeline project. in a dec. 12, 1985 telegram to swiss oilman bruce rappaport, one of the project's partners, he described the plan to ensure the pipeline's safety as ``the capital dod (department of defense) package'' and said it ``appears to be in place,'' according to the post
wallach said in the telegram that the plan had been submitted that day by david wigg, a staff aide at the national security council, to departing national security adviser robert mcfarlane
in another memo, wallach reported to rappaport about a meeting with casey
the meeting with your golfing partner lasted 45 minutes,'' wallach said in what the post said was a reference to casey. ``only d.w. (david wigg) and i were with him. i had met with d.w. for breakfast and reviewed the dod documents.''
in a reference to meese, wallach said that ``my friend'' would, if necessary engage a new person from the national security council on the project
meese's lawyers have said that the attorney general had only a passive role in the project which consisted of referring wallach and then-israeli prime minister shimon peres to mcfarlane
another wallach memo to meese that is the focal point of mckay's probe mentions planned payments to the israeli labor party out of some $650 million to $700 million that was to be paid to israel over 10 years for non-interference with the iraqi pipeline, which was never built
mckay is trying to determine whether the planned payments to the israeli labor party amounted to a bribery scheme which meese should have stepped in to stop. the attorney general has said he doesn't recall reading the reference in the memo to labor party payment plans. the investigation centers around whether meese violated the foreign corrupt practices act
at the news conference, reagan said of meese:
i have every confidence in his integrity. i have known him for more than 20 years.''
reagan also defended the ethical performance of his administration generally, saying that ``those that were doing something wrong and were apprehended ... they're no longer with us.''
the president said that in the case of former cabinet officers such as former labor secretary raymond donovan, all were cleared of wrongdoing after lengthy criminal investigations and indictment
a kind of lynch mob atmosphere ... takes place, but no attention is paid to the fact that'' many of them are ``found to be totally innocent,'' reagan said. donovan was found innocent of fraud in connection with charges that he and seven other businessmen stole $7.4 million in a new york subway project
reagan was asked whether the issue of ethics in the reagan administration would be used effectively by the democrats in the 1988 campaign
i don't know whether they're going to be used effectively or not,'' said reagan. ``i know they're going to be used.''

president reagan and portuguese prime minister anibal cavaco silva have agreed to a broad review of their nations' military, economic and cultural relationship, which is being buffeted by what reagan calls ``harsh budget realities.''
after a two-hour white house meeting on wednesday, the portuguese leader said that because of declining u.s. assistance, he wanted consultations on the relations, as provided in a 1983 cooperation agreement
he assured reagan that ``we do not have the intention of ceasing or reducing the facilities enjoyed by the united states in portuguese territory.'' the goal is to ``identify and overcome existing difficulties,'' he said
at issue is how much assistance the united states is providing portugal in return for base rights, notably at lajes air base _ a major refueling point in the azores islands
in the 1983 agreement, the united states promised its ``best efforts'' to keep aid at the highest levels and granted portugal $205 million the following year. since then assistance has declined, hitting $117 million this year
this did not meet what cavaco silva called ``the legitimate portuguese expectations,'' causing hardship for the nato country as it tries to modernize its armed forces
cavaco silva told guests at an embassy reception wednesday night that the 1983 agreement permits either consultations between the two countries or a revision of the pact
as of now, portugal is asking only for the consultations, but ``it may lead to a revision of the agreement,'' he said
he said portuguese leaders understand the u.s. need to reduce the budget deficit. the portuguese people, however, don't understnad why the united states is not paying portugal the money that was promised, he said
this is affecting in a negative way public opinion in portugal,'' he said
reagan has asked congress for $163 million in the fiscal year beginning oct. 1 and officials have said chances are good the request will be met _ given informal consultations with congress before the budget was submitted
but reagan gave no assurances to cavaco silva, said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity
asked what the consultations requested by cavaco silva would entail, the official said, ``what we are talking about today was the whole of this relationship, and we'll sit down and see what might be available in economic, science, cultural and educational areas that would add to it.''
reagan, who called his talks with cavaco silva ``cordial and candid,'' said, ``portugal's role as a key and trusted ally is much appreciated here. we applaud portugal's desire to modernize its armed forces, and to play a more active role in nato's collective defense efforts
our commitment to assist portugal in these efforts remains firm, ever within the context of the harsh budget realities that we all face.''
under the terms of the defense pact, which expires in 1991, portugal has the right to ask for a midterm review, the form of which is not precisely spelled out
earlier this month, in an effort to soothe portuguese worries about the aid cuts, defense secretary frank c. carlucci went to lisbon and reached agreement with portugal's defense chief to substitute surplus u.s. military equipment for some of the aid lost in the u.s. budget cutbacks
talks are to begin soon to identify the military needs that might be filled with u.s. aid
since carlucci's visit, however, several portuguese leaders have said the surplus equipment promise did not satisfy their requirements, and cavaco silva's comments at the white house reflected that dissatisfaction
people who receive transfusions face a one in 40,000 chance of receiving aids-tainted blood despite screening intended to keep the blood supply clean, according to a federal study published today
the researchers emphasize that despite this ``remote but real risk,'' people who need transfusions should not be deterred from receiving them
the blood supply is relatively safe, dramatically safer than it was before we had any screening,'' said the chief author of the report, dr. john w. ward of the u.s. centers for disease control in atlanta
according to the estimate, published in the new england journal of medicine, up to 460 americans may get aids infections each year from transfusions of tainted blood that slip through blood bank screening programs. by comparison, 7,200 people are thought to have gotten the virus from transfusions in 1984, the year before screening began
the screening tests check blood for antibodies that the body makes in an unsuccessful effort to fight off the aids virus. however, in the first few weeks after an aids infection, antibody levels are very low or absent. as a result, blood given during this period appears to be safe, even though it contains hiv, the aids virus
the cdc researchers believe that most infected blood that gets through the screening program is donated during recent infections before antibodies have developed
the report doesn't surprise me at all. it's just what people predicted would happen,'' said dr. margot kruskall, director of the blood bank at boston's beth israel hospital
in an accompanying editorial in the journal, dr. thomas f. zuck of the university of cincinnati medical center wrote, ``although continued vigilance over the safety of the blood supply is essential, the risk of hiv transmission by transfusion should be kept in perspective.''
he noted that the odds of dying from influenza are one in 5,000, while the risk of dying during a legal abortion after the 14th week of pregnancy is one in 5,900. the annual risk of dying in a car accident is one in 5,000
the cdc report described the cases of seven aids-infected donors whose blood was not spotted by the standard aids screening test, which checks blood for aids antibodies
thirteen people became infected after receiving blood from these men and women. one of them subsequently developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome
the doctors said that about 60 percent of those infected from transfusions die of the diseases for which they are being treated
this doesn't mean the blood supply is not being adequately protected, but it means we may be able to make a good system better,'' said ward
new, more sensitive screening tests are becoming available. ward said they should be evaluated to see if they can shorten the period during which newly infected people have undetectable aids antibodies
homosexual men and others at high risk of aids infection are asked not to donate blood. to help reduce the risk of blood contamination even further, it's important to find more effective ways of discouraging such people from giving blood, ward said
among the infected donors uncovered by the study were a homosexual man who wanted to learn whether he was infected and a bisexual man who said he felt pressured to give blood at work
in general, blood banks discourage donations by any man who has had a homosexual encounter since 1977; needle drug abusers and their sexual partners; female sexual partners of bisexual men; immigrants from haiti or central african countries; men who have had sex with prostitutes since 1977; and hemophiliacs. compensation</head>
life boats, exposure suits and other safety equipment would be mandatory aboard most u.s. commercial fishing vessels under legislation approved by a house committee
the safety provisions were passed wednesday by the house merchant marine and fisheries committee despite objections from the reagan administration, which says voluntary programs are preferable
but lawmakers delayed a vote on setting compensation rates for injured seamen, a provision that sunk the legislative package two years ago
under the measure drafted by rep. gerry e. studds, d-mass., most commercial fishing boat operators would have to ensure that their vessels have life boats, exposure suits for all crew members, navigation and communication equipment, emergency beacons and first aid kits
new vessels that carry more than 16 people also may be required to install radar devices and face minimum requirements for insulation material, fuel, ventilation and electrical systems
civil penalties would include fines of up to $5,000. criminal penalties for willful violators would carry penalties of up to $5,000 in fines and one year in prison
two years after enactment, the transportation department would be required to submit legislation to license commercial fishing boat operators
similar legislation that combined the boating safety requirements with an injury compensation provision was killed in 1986 on a 241-181 house vote following a lobbying blitz by the association of trial lawyers
members of that group commonly represent plaintiffs in lawsuits, and they objected to set limits on the amount of compensation that could be obtained for injuries
george bush, shoring up support in his summer-home state as republicans prepare for weekend caucuses here, is looking for a strong win to bolster his campaign after losses in minnesota and south dakota
michael dukakis, the governor of massachusetts, was also playing up his home-court advantage as the democrats geared up for their caucuses
bush, who greeted supporters during a half-hour stop at the portland airport on wednesday, said he was disappointed but not surprised by his weak finishes in minnesota and south dakota
he bypassed campaigning in the two states in the face of the strength of rivals bob dole and pat robertson
i think the result was somewhat anticipated,'' the vice president said. ``you can't win them all.''
bush, who has a summer home in kennebunkport, is heavily favored to win maine's republican caucuses, most of which are being held this weekend, although he said he was taking nothing for granted
i think we have to do our best. the same is true for all these southern states,'' bush said, referring to delegate-rich super tuesday contests of march 8
among maine democrats, dukakis is widely viewed as the front-runner. dukakis, who split victories with rep. richard gephardt in minnesota and south dakota on tuesday, spoke at a party dinner in bangor last weekend, and aides said he tentatively planned to campaign in southern maine on sunday
we're looking to win, period,'' said david villarino, the maine campaign manager for dukakis, adding that the biggest concern was turning out supporters at the caucuses
we're not perceiving a lot of excitement'' among party members, he said
campaign workers for the other candidates in both parties played up expectations of bush and dukakis victories this weekend
they forecast battles for second and third place between dole and robertson in the gop caucuses and between democrats gephardt and jesse jackson
a leader of dole's maine campaign, state sen. pamela cahill of woolwich, said she was optimistic about dole's prospects but did not expect him to win in the state
jeff nelson, who was brought in from michigan to serve as robertson's press secretary in maine, predicted a battle for second place between dole and robertson, although he suggested his candidate is stronger
the dole forces are ``struggling for second, we're struggling for first,'' nelson said
on the democratic side, a gephardt spokesman saw no prospect of defeating dukakis in ``his own front yard.'' dukakis showed his strength in the region with a decisive win in last week's new hampshire primary
the massachusetts government is up here,'' said jim case. ``i don't know if you'd call it a government in exile or a government on leave.''
jackson spokesman bob philbrook also cited ``overwhelming'' support in the state for dukakis but said the campaign was buoyed by jackson's showing in minnesota, where he claimed 20 percent of the vote, placing second to dukakis
we're going to do better than that in maine,'' philbrook said. books</head>
the 40 finalists in a competition to select the top young scientists in the country say they spent an average of 18 hours a week studying and no hours watching television for entertainment
the finalists in the 47th science talent search, a prestigious national competition for high school seniors, said in a survey released wednesday that they each read an average of about 40 books a year outside of school. forty-five percent said they spent five hours a week reading newspapers and 47.5 percent said they watched five hours weekly of network and local television
none, however, reported watching any television for entertainment
but despite their scholarly dedication, two-thirds of the group still believe the high school years should include some extra-curricular activities such as dances and football games
i feel that students will go crazy without some social diversions,'' said scott d. zucker, 17, a student from south plantation high school in plantation, fla
only about 16 percent of the group thought football and proms could be dropped from high schools
the curriculum is far too often subordinated to social and sports events,'' said david a. cooke, 17, the midland park, n.j., high school valedictorian. ``schools are designed to educate.''
according to most studies, the 18 hours a week spent by students in the group is far above the national average. a 1980 federal study showed only 25 percent of u.s. high school students spent more than five hours a week on homework. and a recent american council on education survey of 250,000 college freshmen showed only 7.1 percent spent 16 or more hours a week in high school on homework
the science talent search finalists were selected from 1,339 entries in the 47th annual national competition funded by westinghouse electric corp. the competition, open to high school seniors, involves science projects created, researched and assembled by the students. five past winners have gone on to become nobel prize winners
the finalists come from 17 states and are in washington for final judging in the competition. winners will be announced at a banquet monday night when scholarships and cash prizes worth $140,000 will be awarded. top prize is a $20,000 scholarship
in the survey, the talent search scholars were asked how they spent their time on a weekly basis. the averages, expressed in hours per week, were:
studying, 18 hours
friendships, 7.9 hours
family, six hours
pleasure reading, five hours
part-time jobs, 4.7 hours
participant sports, 4.6 hours
student affairs, 3.8 hours
other (includes independent research), 3.6 hours
community affairs, 1.7 hours
spectator sports, 1.5 hours

republican presidential candidate pat robertson appears ready to push his politically risky libel suit against a former congressman who questioned his war record even though the trial is set for super tuesday
robertson, who once expressed reget he ever brought the case, says former rep. paul n. mccloskey, r-calif., is a ``patent liar'' for saying he invoked the political influence of his late father, sen. a. willis robertson, d-va., to avoid combat in the korean war
at a press conference in atlanta on wednesday, robertson conceded that going to trial march 8 _ a day he hopes to do well in a dozen southern primaries _ leaves him in ``an untenable position.''
i have a choice of fulfilling my constitutional right to run for president ... or every american's right to have his day in court,'' robertson told reporters
the trial is going ahead. i'm looking for some alternative, we haven't made up our mind,'' robertson said, hinting he might seek a way out of his political and legal dilemma
but robertson insisted that paying mccloskey's legal fees of nearly $400,000 ``is not an option'' even though the former congressman says he would settle on that basis
i wouldn't pay a nickel to somebody who is a patent liar,'' robertson said
mccloskey said robertson's position means a trial of the case is likely to begin on super tuesday before u.s. district judge joyce hens green, who refused robertson's earlier request to postpone the proceeding until after the primaries are over
at this stage he has already put us close to $400,000 in legal fees, we might as well go to trial,'' mccloskey said in a telephone interview. ``i think that the jury is the best possible place to determine if he is telling the truth or i am.''
roberston filed the lawsuit after two syndicated columns published the contents of a letter mccloskey wrote to rep. andrew jacobs jr., d-ind., charging that the former television evangelist cabled his father from japan to get out of combat duty
mccloskey, a decorated marine who was aboard the troop ship from which robertson was removed, also said the former television evangelist was a ``booze officer'' to a rear-echelon unit
professional political analysts have questioned robertson's judgment in filing the case. robertson himself was quoted by time magazine last september as saying: ``in all candor, i think it was a bad idea.''
because of the possibility of intense media coverage during the three-week trial, political professionals have questioned the wisdom of proceeding with the suit
the thing is so dangerous for him, i would just get out of the thing any way i could get out,'' said democratic political consultant robert beckel, adding: ``i see nothing coming out of it good politically for him.''
most people are not aware of the allegation, the average voter hasn't focused on robertson's war record. nobody is going to attack him on it. why raise it yourself?'' beckel said
charles black, who is working for rival gop candidate jack kemp, said, ``i've always thought it was a big negative for him.''
i'm not in a position to judge who's right and who's wrong about the charges,'' he said. but ``having a libel trial right in the middle of the primary season will obviously dramatize the charges against him.''
by proceeding to trial, robertson risks extensive news coverage of potentially embarrassing testimony by several former marines who support mccloskey's story and add tales of their own
one former marine said in a deposition that robertson ``messed around with the prostitutes'' and was ``scared to death'' of contracting gonorrhea. robertson's lawyers are trying to suppress that comment from the trial as irrelevent to the issues in the case
despite robertson's expressed misgivings over going forward, lawyers for both sides say they are preparing to try the case and are not talking about a settlement
a federal trade commission member says he's told his aides not to put anything in writing anymore since a congressional panel forced him to disclose documents under threat of finding him in contempt of congress
commissioner terry calvani escaped the contempt citation wednesday by appearing under subpoena before the house committee on energy and commerce's subcommittee on oversight and investigations and turning over the requested documents, ending a battle that began last october
i tell the men and women that serve in my office that i want their wholly candid assessment and unvarnished recommendation about matters before me,'' he told the panel, headed by rep. john d. dingell, d-mich. ``this morning i have instructed my staff that from henceforth they should not commit their work to paper.''
the internal documents demanded by the panel concerned the ftc's views on whether unfair and deceptive advertising practices were occurring in the airline industry
the ftc had written a letter to the national association of attorneys general which reflected that the agency had not studied the matter. a press release on the question, however, indicated that the agency believed the airline industry had no such problems
the reading of a reference to the press release comment on the house floor last october helped defeat an amendment by dingell that would have transferred responsibility for airline industry consumer protection from the department of transportation to the ftc, said subcommittee counsel patrick mclain
rep. michael bilirakis, r-fla., said the statement indicated to the house members that the ftc believed airline industry consumer protection was fine as it was and there was no need for the ftc to take over
the amendment intended to help the consumers of the country was greatly thwarted,'' he said
several days after the vote, the subcommittee began asking the ftc for internal documents on the matter
two commissioners said they had no such documents, two others allowed subcommittee staff to read pertinent materials in their offices, but calvani refused to provide access to such documents
after the subcommittee and calvani exchanged several letters, the panel on feb. 4 subpoenaed calvani to appear and bring the documents
calvani said that until friday, the panel had not provided the legal justification for him to provide the requested materials
after testifying, calvani said he believed he had become caught in a ``turf fight'' between dingell and rep. james j. howard, d-n.j., chairman of the committee on public works and transportation, who wanted the transportation department to keep control of airline industry consumer protection
they were looking for a scapegoat, and i'm the unfortunate person chosen for that,'' he said
dingell's office referred all requests for a response to calvani's allegation to mclain, who refused to comment
however, both republican and democratic panel members said during the hearing that they supported the issuance of the subpoena and the need for the documents. administration</head>
president reagan questioned gop hopeful pat robertson's contention that he had information about american hostages being held in lebanon, saying if the former television evangelist did have such knowledge, ``he kept it to himself.''
it'd be very strange if he actually did have information as to the location of those hostages,'' the president said at a nationally broadcast news conference wednesday night. ``isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?''
robertson said wednesday his christian broadcasting network once knew the whereabouts of american hostages in lebanon ``and they could have been freed.'' robertson spokesmen later said the the former television evangelist was referring to hostages seized when a twa flight was hijacked to beirut in 1985, who were eventually freed
when he was asked about robertson's assertion, reagan said he didn't want to comment on the campaign. but he said of the hostages: ``we have tried our best and through every kind of channel to establish their whereabouts because that's the beginning of efforts to try and get them free.''
if he thought that he knew'' where hostages were being held, reagan said of robertson, ``he kept it to himself.''
it's very frustrating to try and establish a location,'' said the president. ``but we've never let up, and we never will, in trying to obtain the freedom of all the hostages.''
nine americans are in captivity in lebanon, including marine lt. col. william r. higgins, who was captured last week. terry anderson, chief middle east correspondent of the associated press, is the longest-held captive, having been kidnapped on march 16, 1985
robertson spokesman scott hatch said after reagan spoke: ``i think what pat said was accurate.''
even before the president's news conference, robertson's comments drew quick criticism from two of his gop presidential rivals, rep. jack kemp and vice president george bush
kemp, in a statement, called robertson's statements irresponsible and said he should ``apologize to the families of the hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt to gain publicity.''
i don't think it was irresponsible at all,'' said hatch. ``the whole context was how pat would deal with terrorism, and he used that as an example.''
bush, campaigning in boston, said: ``my question would be, how come he didn't get hold of the proper authorities in the united states government that were working day and night, trying to figure out how they could get these people out?''
robertson's comments came at an atlanta news conference during which he complained that u.s. intelligence in the middle east is inadequate and declared that action must be quick when americans are taken hostage
we identified in our news department at cbn the location of those hostages in lebanon very shortly after they were taken, and they were in a position where they could have been rescued,'' he said
they were in beirut, and they could have been freed.''
robertson did not provide specifics and did not say which hostages were involved
benton miller, spokesman for cbn, based in virginia beach, va., said the comments pertained to hostages who had been taken from twa flight 847 in 1985. he later issued a synopsis of the news report to which robertson referred
the synopsis said that in response to a question from robertson, a cbn middle east correspondent, who was not named, said the hostages, ``are in several locations in and around lebanon and we have also learned that maybe at least one of them, and we do not know which one, but we have been told by intelligence sources in lebanon, that at least one may be being held in tehran.''
the suspicion concerning the hostage thought to be held in tehran was later reported as incorrect in a subsequent news report on robertson's ``700 club'' talk show, miller said
asked whether he had told the reagan administration what he knew, robertson said, ``i broadcast it on national television; they monitor our programs virtually every day.''
robertson aide gary lane said during the twa hostage situation, the state department contacted cbn for information at that time, but he said he did not know exactly who made the contact
a state department terrorism expert said he was puzzled by robertson's statements, saying he was unaware that cbn had ever broadcast the precise locations of any hostages
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said knowledge of hostages' whereabouts in terms of a particular city or even a section of a city wouldn't be enough to mount a rescue mission
robertson's comments on the hostages marked the second time in two weeks that his statements on international matters have sparked controversy. during a republican presidential debate on feb. 14, he alleged that the soviets have nuclear missiles in cuba, pointing to the united states. the reagan administration denied it
in yet another controversy, bush asked robertson to apologize or provide proof to back up his suggestion on tuesday that anti-robertson political motivations were behind the timing of public allegations of sexual misconduct against television evangelist jimmy swaggart
by sundown in the old south, i'd like to see him stand up like a southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' bush said. ``i'd like to see an apology or proof.''
it seemed at first like an innovative way of getting the british to talk about something other than the weather. but things apparently went too far
talkabout, a telephone company service linking strangers together for chats in groups of up to 10 at a time, was forced to hang up permanently this week under a barrage of public criticism
for british telecom, the country's main telephone company, talkabout was a gold mine. the company's privatization in 1984 after decades of state ownership has made it far more profit-conscious and talkabout earned it up to $17.5 million a year
but parents complained talkabout rang up huge phone bills. members of parliament claimed it had become a dating service and drug exchange. lurid tales circulated of girls being seduced by older men and of young neo-nazis pouring out racist hatred
while the tabloid press highlighted the sensational aspects of talkabout, the office of telecommunications (oftel), the phone company's watchdog body, warned that british telecom's monopoly privileges would be reviewed unless customers could have talkabout blocked from their lines
british telecom said the cost would be prohibitive and on monday it stopped the service
no one claims to have actually heard the service being seriously abused, and british telecom hotly denies the seduction stories. if anything, say critics who called in to hear talkabout for themselves, the conversations generally were dull and witless
nonetheless, terry lewis, a lawmaker for the opposition labor party who campaigned against talkabout, insisted ``the service is obscene, dangerous, addictive and costly.''
costly, definitely. at up to 71 cents a minute at peak time, talkabout cost eight times more than an ordinary call
addictive, perhaps. youngsters calling in to a radio talk show said they sometimes spent up to four hours a day on talkabout
but obscene and dangerous? british telecom says the service attracted 40 million calls but only 27 complaints since its inception in 1983
we provided a quite innocent and socially useful pastime to many thousands of customers,'' the company said in a statement announcing talkabout's closure
british telecom says it was prepared for trouble from the outset, and built in safeguards
conversations were limited to 10 minutes and separate services existed for teen-agers and for adults
a tape recording warned callers not to divulge surnames, addresses or phone numbers during conversation, and about 200 monitors stood by at the 25 talkabout exchanges around the country, ready to step in and cut off abusers
none of that,'' a monitor would interject the moment a conversation looked like veering into smut or racism. ``you know the rules. if you won't behave i will cut you off.''
but conversation was often an unintelligible mish-mash of competing voices. even if an interesting conversation got going, the 10-minute rule soon guillotined it
the notion of talkabout as a battering ram against the fabled reserve of the british character was ``one of our theories,'' a british telecom spokesman said, insisting on anonymity citing company rules
people sit opposite each other on the train five days a week going to work and never talk. some of them would probably love an anonymous chat on talkabout,'' he added
a former cuban political prisoner in the reagan administration is being portrayed by havana as a terrorist, liar and impostor who has become a key figure in a u.s. effort to discredit cuba
cuba escalated its campaign on wednesday against armando valladares, head of the u.s. delegation to the u.n. human rights commission in geneva, accusing the state department of spreading ``15 lies'' about his past
the reagan administration has described valladares as a victim of cuban repression who spent 22 years in prison merely for expressing opposition to communism. it has denied cuban charges that valladares worked for the secret police of the rightist dictatorship that was overthrown by fidel castro and his forces in 1959
cuban diplomats in washington, the united nations and geneva distributed a 37-page pamphlet outlining the purported u.s. lies and making public a state department document where the alleged misrepresentations are said to have been made
cuba released the pamphlet as valladares was preparing an attempt to win approval by the u.n. commission of a resolution seeking to place cuba's human rights practices on the 1989 agenda of the panel. a similar effort last year failed by a single vote
valladares is perhaps best known for his book, ``against all hope,'' in which he outlines what he claims was his systematic mistreatment during his long detention
the cuban document, disputing the state department, said valladares was never ``a prisoner of conscience'' but rather a subversive who later became a ``dissident manufactured by the government of the united states ... to serve its anti-cuban campaigns.''
the cuban document said that valladares worked for a counter-revolutionary group found to possess lethal weapons. but the state department contended that a thorough search of valladares' home after his december 1960 arrest turned up no weapons or other evidence of subversive activities
the 10-page undated state department memo made public by the cuban government appeared to be authentic, according to a u.s. official who is familiar with valladares' role in the government
the memo was sent as a cable to all u.s. diplomatic and consular posts for use as a counter to the ``massive defamation campaign'' against valladares being waged by cuba
the cuban document, discussing the u.s. ``lies'' about valladares, also said it is not true that:
_cuba had ever declared that valladares had engaged in torture while serving in the pre-revolutionary secret police
_valladares was arrested for speaking out against communism and for refusing to display a sign of revolutionary propaganda on his office desk
_cuba manufactured a forged police identity card in an effort to verify his service in the secret police
travelers know they're in the south when: a) the confederate flag is flying over the state capitol; b) there are more pickups than cars on the highway; c) a transplanted asiatic vine entangles practically everything
unfortunately farmers, loggers, utilities and lovers of roadside scenery know the answer is c
people all over the south know and curse kudzu (pronounced kuhd'-zoo). the transplanted vine once thought to be a savior has acquired a status akin to a carpetbagger
planted heavily in mississippi and other southern states during the depression to control erosion, kudzu's welcome soon wore out as it spread from the gullies it was planted in. it now covers an area the size of belgium
there are mixed opinions about it,'' said james wolfe, a plant materials specialist with the u.s. department of agriculture's soil conservation service, an agency responsible for kudzu planting during the 1930's
a lot of people seem to fear it quite a bit. i don't think it's as bad as some people would say,'' wolfe said last week. ``it may not be beneficial, but it's got a lot of character about it as you travel down the highway and see it climbing all over trees.''
kudzu has spread as far as 25 miles on each side of the road where it was planted 40 years ago, covering trees, old houses and abandoned cars. the lumber industry, in particular, is not fond of the plant because it can kill trees by blocking out the light
some of the heaviest concentrations in mississippi can be found in the rich cotton-farming area in the delta region. macabre formations of the clinging vine can be seen suffocating trees as travelers pass through towns such as flora, yazoo city and tchula on mississippi 49
the vine, brought from japan in 1876 as an ornamental plant, can grow as much as 100 feet in a summer _ a foot a day. and without harsh winters to kill it, or natural predators, it picks up each spring where it left off the previous fall
the weight of its vines has been known to pull down utility lines
kudzu is tough to control. if we don't keep it down it will climb the poles and guidelines and cause electrical outages,'' mississippi power &amp; light spokesman ed jussely said. ``through a consistant maintenance program we have been successful in stopping the outages, but it is a difficult problem for us every year.''
kudzu now covers over 7 million acres in mississippi, georgia, alabama and parts of surrounding states. it extends as far north as southern missouri and west virginia, and as far west as texas
farmers, utilities and the lumber industry are engaged in a never-ending battle against kudzu _ alabama even passed a law against owning kudzu seeds or seedlings
the only thing that will stop it is constant cutting. farmers often let cattle feed on kudzu because its nutritional value is about the same as alfalfa and overgrazing will kill it
outside of open pasture, however, kudzu is king. a variety of chemicals and other methods have been tried to stop it, none with much success
generally, programs involve a paper company or a few farmers, but there is not a statewide program to get rid of it,'' said wayne houston, a weed specialist at mississippi state university. ``generally, whatever you put down to kill kudzu also kills the trees. it's difficult and expensive to kill it.''
president reagan says the question of soviet participation in an international trade organization is currently ``being reviewed,'' even though his administration has staunchly opposed such a move in the past
during his news conference wednesday night, reagan was asked whether he would discuss trade liberalization in his upcoming meeting in moscow with soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev, and whether he supports the soviet bid to join the general agreement on tariffs and trade
i do know that there has been consideration of them involving themselves in the gatt procedure, and that, of course, is being reviewed among those of us who are participants now,'' reagan said
in the past, the united states has led the effort to block soviet participation in the 95-nation compact which sets and enforces international trading rules
just last jan. 20, presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater underscored the administration's opposition to soviet participation in either gatt or its sister economic organizations, the world bank and the international monetary fund
the soviet economic system ``remains at this point fundamentally incompatible with participation in free-world institutions,'' fitzwater said at the time. ``in essence, they don't have a free-world economy
the treasury department and the administration remain opposed to soviet membership.''
a position of continued opposition to soviet membership in the international financial organizations also was spelled out in a january report to congress from the white house, entitled ``national security strategy of the united states.''
that report did note ``soviet policy statements regarding reconstruction and economic reform,'' suggesting to some analysts that the gatt-membership question was an open one
however, the report went on to add, ``the soviet economic system remains at this point fundamentally incompatible with participation in free world institutions.''
in september 1986, the united states successfully led the opposition to a soviet effort to join gatt to participate in a new round of trade-liberalization talks, now under way in geneva
reagan declined to go into details of what he would discuss with gorbachev during his moscow visit this spring
on the general subject of east-west trade, reagan said: ``our trade with the soviet union is restricted mainly on the basis of where we might be giving them technology and information that could be used one day against us.''
currently, most high-tech equipment is banned from export to the soviet union. however, the administration is currently at work trimming the list of non-strategic items than can be shipped to the soviet bloc
here is a transcript of president reagan's news conference wednesday night
on the networks at last! (laughter
good evening
before i take your questions, i have a brief opening statement
secretary of state george shultz today reported to me on his recent trip to moscow and it was encouraging
progress continues to be made on our four-part agenda and the commitment remains to do all that we can to advance the cause of peace and to settle regional conflicts
in the middle east, it's time for all parties to rid themselves of old ideas and stances that cannot work and to begin a serious process of negotiation and reconciliation
any process that is undertaken must meet israel's security needs and satisfy the legitimate rights of the palestinians
secretary shultz leaves tonight for the middle east to see if practical and real progress can be made that provides a pathway to a comprehensive settlement
and he carries with him my full support
there's another regional conflict that has serious implications for our country's security interests, nicaragua
our policy consistently has been to bring peace and freedom to all of central america
today, four of the five central american countries choose their governments in free and open democratic elections
independent courts protect their human rights, and their people can hope for a better life for themselves and their children
one country, nicaragua, with its communist regime, remains a threat to this democratic tide in the region
so our message to the people of nicaragua tonight is the same as it has been for the past seven years _ freedom based on true democratic principles
in the past several months there have been some limited steps taken by the communist regime in nicaragua toward reform
now is not the time to reverse that process
so there's no argument that all of us seek peace and democracy in nicaragua, and the difference is how to achieve that goal
on feb. 3, congress voted on continued support for the democratic resistance in nicaragua
and to my disappointment, the majority in the house of representatives voted to remove the pressure of the democratic resistance on the sandinista regime
however, the senate agreed with me, that we cannot leave those fighting for freedom in nicaragua at the mercy of the communist regime and expect the process toward democracy to move ahead
we've already seen what happens when pressure is removed
in just two short weeks, the sandinistas threatened the only free press in that country and rejected a cease-fire proposal made by the mediator, cardinal obando, which incorporated the essential elements laid out and agreed to last august
and in the first two months of 1988, soviet military assistance to nicaragua has almost doubled, compared to the same period in 1987
these do not represent signs of peace
these remain troubling indications of a regime determined to crush its opposition and threaten its neighbors
there is a choice
we must act to ensure that freedom is not smothered in nicaragua and to guarantee that these latest promises will be kept in a timely way
end of statement. and helen?
q. mr. president, through the years you've been very eloquent on the subject of human rights in the soviet union and nicaragua. why _ the question really is, why have you never condemned the treatment of the palestinians in the occupied areas. shooting unarmed protestors, beating people to death _ children, trying to bury some alive. and i'd like to follow up
a. helen, we have made _ we have spoken to the government there
and we've also spoken to the palestinian leadership because there's every evidence that these riots are not just spontaneous and homegrown
but we have spoken, and we have _ and that's why _ part of the reason why the secretary of state is going back over there
we don't support that sort of thing, and we're trying to persuade all the participants to try to arrive at a solution representing justice for all
q. well, if you want that, and you say you believe in security for israel and legitimate rights of the palestinians, why don't you go on the public record now and say that there should be an exchange _ a removal of the occupation and a peace?
a. well, i don't think it's up to us to dictate a settlement in the middle east
q. we are great supporters of israel, so we certainly have some influence
a. yes, and we have used that a number of times and are using it now
but, we think that _ and the thing that is taking the secretary of state there _ we think that the necessity is for all who are represented in that situation on both sides should come together when you stop to think that legitimate _ that legally a state of war still exists there in the middle east between the arab nations and israel, and that it's time for us to arrive at a true peace and recognize the rights of all
q. mr. president, shiite militia men are scouring southern lebanon for colonel higgins, the american kidnapped last week, and you've expressed a determination to get him out. can you say that the same intense efforts, the same kind of dragnet will be used to find the other american hostages, one of whom, terry anderson, is about to mark the end of his third year in captivity?
a. we have never given up on that
it's _ as you can realize, it's very frustrating to try and establish a location, knowing of course that you are governed by the fact that unwise action on our part could bring about harm to the hostages
but, we've never let up and we never will in trying to obtain the freedom of all the hostages
q. sir, pat robertson said today that his christian broadcasting network once knew the location of american hostages in the middle east and that the united states in effect missed an opportunity to rescue them. i understand he's clarified that remark, but i wonder if you have any thoughts about the tone that he's setting in this campaign?
a. well, all i can say _ i don't want to comment on the campaign, but i can only say this, that it would be very strange if he actually did have information as to the location of those hostages
isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?
we have tried our best and through every kind of channel to establish their whereabouts because that's the beginning of efforts to try and get them free
but, i just _ if he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself. trude
q. mr. president, as of now, is there any change in our policy of not talking with the plo in light of the fact that there are reports out of geneva that mr. arafat is now ready to accept u.n. resolution 338 and 242?
a. well, i know that this is one other thing we're pursuing
if he really is, and if he is willing to acknowledge the right of israel to exist as a nation _ this has been one of the blocking points, that, how do you sit down and try to get into a talk about peace when someone says they have no right to even exist?
and i'm sure that the secretary of state will be _ is apprised of that fact, and will see what we can do there
q. and given _ may i follow up?
a. yes
q. and given the 40-year hostility in the area which has been built up, how can you as the great communicator try to alleviate some of the antagonism between the israelis and the palestinians before you leave office?
a. well, we are trying to, and we'll continue to try to
that's a goal that i think would _ i would think would be one of the greatest achievements of this administration, if before i leave, we could bring about a peace in the middle east
q. mr. president, whom precisely are you criticizing when you say that the riots are not homegrown and not spontaneous?
a. well, we have had _ it's a little difficult for me, because i _ there's some things that i shouldn't be saying. but we have had intimations that there have been certain people suspected of being terrorists, outsiders coming in, not only with weapons, but stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those areas
now, that isn't something you can go out and say we absolutely know, but certainly the violence is both ways
q. but it would seem, sir, that that's still a generalization, if you say some people from the outside. can't you not be specific and say just who it is?
a. no, because i get into areas there that would be violating security rules, and i don't think i should
q. the plo, russians?
a. what?
q. plo? russians?
a. no. no
q. mr. president, it's my understanding that in 1985 your national security adviser, robert mcfarlane, briefed you on the iraqi pipeline project, and got and gained your approval for it. in light of the difficulties that your attorney general, mr. meese, is encountering now, could you explain your position on the pipeline and tell me if you think it was a good idea at that time?
q. i have no recall of knowing anything about this pipeline plan until fairly recently, and then found out with regard to the transmittal of the letters that have now been turned over to the special investigator. and this was about the first information that i recall having
now, i can't say to you that something _ that i was given information earlier, because i just have to tell you if i was, i have totally forgotten _ that i have no knowledge of anything of that kind
q. well, mr. president, does it trouble you at all that your dear friend mr. meese has become entangled in this project, and it has yet been another case which has brought him some, some would say, embarrassment?
a. let me just say one thing, i have every confidence in his integrity
i've known him for more than 20 years, but i cannot comment in any way on this case that is now before a special investigator
sam?
q. mr. president, the white minority government of south africa has now effectively banned activities by dissenting organizations, even when those activities are peaceful. what is your view on that, and what can you do, if anything, to reverse it?
a. well, the state department has already contacted them about that, and we are making our own feelings clear that they should be working toward a multiracial democracy, and not oppressing organization _ political organizations there
and we've made our feelings clear about that
q. well, sir, may i follow up? have you considered sending aid to the freedom fighters _ the anc or any other organization _ against this oppression just as you send aid to other freedom fighters around the world?
a. no, we have not involved ourselves in that other than things such as the sanctions and so forth
we have tried our best to be persuasive in this very difficult problem and to find _ or to encourage a better solution
q. well, what's the difference?
a. well, the difference is that we don't have an armed insurrection going as we have in some other countries, and we have a great division even among the people who are being oppressed
it is a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy, and that is one of the most difficult parts here
q. mr. president, throughout your administration, when members of your cabinet or members of the administration have been accused of any kind of wrongdoing or simply of bad judgment, it's been your policy generally to say nothing. is your loyalty more important to you than the perception that the members of the government must be above reproach?
a. no, bill, and i have to say that i do not favor violations of ethics or laws at all in or out of government, but i do want to call your attention to one thing
i think _ and this has gone on pretty much throughout the time that i've been here _ that there is a kind of lynch-mob atmosphere that takes place, and people are _ the memories are there of this person, that person and so forth, but no attention is paid to the fact that how many of them, when it actually came to trial, was found to be totally innocent, but in the meantime, they have been smeared nationwide, and it's very difficult for people to remember what the outcome was
they only remember the other of the _ in other words, guilt was by accusation and not by actual trial and conviction
and i could call to your attention, too, ray donovan, jim beggs of the space program _ both of them totally cleared of any wrongdoing whatsoever, and this has been true of a great many others
but those that were doing something wrong and were apprehended and it was proven on them, they're no longer with us
q. well, sir, people have asked if, as in the case of the iran-contra affair, when the committee which investigated it said that _ noted that you never condemned the actions of those members of your staff who were involved. the question was raisd whether your silence meant that you did not find their actions objectionable?
a. no, they _ when they came under the judgment of the law and the judgment was made and _ great regret if someone was guilty of wrongdoing, but they were punished accordingly
q. mr. president, what are you doing to make things easier for corporations to trade with the soviet union in non-strategic items, such as food processing, pharmaceuticals, automotive, and hotels, for instance? and do you believe the soviet union should join gatt, the general agreement on trade and tariffs? and will you discuss these and other trade items with mr. gorbachev in your forthcoming summit?
a. well, i can't relate to you discussions about those particular things with him
but i do know that there has been consideration of them involving themselves in the gatt procedure, and that, of course, is being reviewed among those of us who are participants now
but i don't know whether that answers your question, or not, but our trade with the soviet union is restricted mainly on the basis of where we might be giving them technology and information that is _ could be used one day against us
q. mr. president, i know you have to remain neutral in the republican race, but you could clear up a major issue right now by telling us whether george bush, in fact, did have reservations about the sale of arms to iran, whether he had reservations about israel's role in that policy and whether, in fact, he's telling the truth when he tells us that he did have those reservations
a. yes, in the general discussion _ and that's not unusual here
i've ordered our people on cabinet matters or anything else and i want to hear what they really feel
i don't want to be surrounded by ``yes'' men
and, yes, there were reservations, but i'm not going to go into _ just as he wouldn't go into the private discussions that we may have had
but i think it's time for me to point out what the opposition was based on of anyone who did oppose
particularly, it's been revealed that secretary weinberger and george shultz both objected
they did not object the idea of _ that we were trading arms for hostages
their objection _ they knew what we were trying to do
this had been a request that came to us from some people not in the government of iran, but who wanted to privately meet with us on how there could be a better relationship if and when the day came that there was a new government in iran
and if you'll remember, back in those days, almost every other day there was speculation that the health of the khomeini was failing to where there might be this contest for a new government
their objection was _ what we had done _ we'd gotten this request and in dealing with it, in this conversation with these private individuals _ we pointed out our feelings about terrorism and so forth
they agreed with us
and the thing was that they _ the hezbollah, as we know, is philosophically attuned to iran
the idea was that they could perhaps influence the hezbollah to give up some of our hostages
and indeed, as the talks went on, they did
we got two of them free
but their objection was that if and when this became known, as it would be, it would be made to appear that we were trading hostages for _ or arms for hostages
now, we were _ we were getting these arms to these individuals because we felt that maybe they could influence the hezbollah
we weren't dealing with the kidnappers at all
and this was what the whole situation was
but it turned out that george and cap, and those who had doubts, were right in that when it did become known, by way of a henchman of the ayatollah, then everyone just automatically said that _ and to this day are saying it was arms for hostages
q. on the issue of george bush and his role though, this has become one of the major issues between the vice president and senator dole. now, although you have to remain neutral, as the author of the 11th commandment, thou shalt not criticize one's fellow republicans, do you have any advice for these two men, and aren't you getting a little concerned that they might be hurting the republican chances by their very bitter political feud?
a. well, whether i am concerned or not, i am not going to comment on things like that
i am going to say that they know my feelings, all of them, about the 11th commandment
q. no advice at all to them?
a. jerry
q. mr. president, the resignation of secretary of the navy webb has ignited a controversy about the _ your build-up of the united states navy. and the question is, are you satisfied with the budget cuts in the military have not damaged our national security, and are you still committed to a 600-ship navy at a time when the soviets are not cutting their navy?
q. i am committed to the 600-ship navy, and i want you to know, jerry, that from the very beginning since i've been here, the congress has cut my request for defense every time
and sometimes, they have tried to pretend that that is in an effort to reduce the deficit spending and so forth
but in a five-year period, the congress cut my defense budgets a total of $125 billion at the same time that they increased my request for domestic programs by $250 billion
and this _ this budget which is now being attributed to me _ no, this isn't as low as they originally wanted to cut it
but it was as high as we could get it in the negotiations for the present budget
and it has been harmful, but let me tell you that in 1980 when we came here, the navy had 479 vessels. and by 1987, we had 568. and by next year it will be 580
and so what has happened is that there will be a little delay in the achieving of the 600-ship navy
but i can't help but remind, or tell all of you _ when i was campaigning in 1980 and knew the state of our defenses, i was faced with a question _ and some of you will recall _ i did a lot of campaigning on question-and-answer basis
at almost every gathering, there would be a question _ well, if i came to a choice between deficit spending and build-up of our defense structure, which would i choose?
and every time, i said, in responsibility, i would have to choose the build-up of our defenses
and every time, in every audience in america that i said that to, gave me an applause that was almost an ovation for saying that
q. the second part of the question was, is it a threat to the national security that the navy is not going to have 600 ships _ on the schedule that you had in mind?
a. i don't think right at the moment, and with the way we're progressing in various treaties and so forth, i don't believe that the threat is that immediate
and _ but because very shortly, we will achieve our 600
we want 15 carriers and their squadrons, and we've just launched the 15th carrier, 100 nuclear-powered attack submarines and four battleships, and we're achieving them
q. mr. president, you must certify by march 1 whether panama has been cracking down on drug trafficking through that country, or whether aid to panama should be continued to be suspended. what are you going to do?
a. well, i can't give you the answer yet because we're still working on that and still collecting the facts as to what their effort has been at trying to intercept the drugs and join us in that campaign
but, as you said, march 1 we will be giving the answer
q. sir, if i could follow up, some officials in your administration have suggested that if noriega would step down and go into exile, that you would stop the prosecution of him on drug charges. would you consider that kind of deal?
a. no, and i'm not going to comment on something of this kind
this man has been indicted by a federal grand jury, and so i'm not going to make any comment of that kind, nor have we made any advances or suggestions of that kind to the government of panama
what we would like to see is a return to democracy and a civilian government in panama, and not this domination by literally a military dictator
q. mr. president, federal reserve chairman alan greenspan today objected to pressure from the administration regarding the formulation of monetary policy, such as contained in the budget and the economic report and a treasury letter to federal reserve board members. don't you have confidence in your appointee to the fed, alan greenspan, as chairman?
a. yes, i do, and i'm going to have to find out what this is all about that you're talking about. because nothing of that kind had been directed to me
q. mr. president, back to the contra aid question _ in your opening statement you seemed to suggest that the sandinistas are taking advantage of congress not coming through with contra aid to withdraw some of the concessions that had made. with congress about to consider new humanitarian aid, both the democratic and republican plan, is it worth it to pass humanitarian aid without military aid?
a. well, i think the only comment that i can make there is that anything that will keep the freedom fighters as a pressure on the sandinistas is worth doing
just as when we tried to pass our own bill and narrowly failed, you could see that the military aid was down the road a ways _ it was not necessary right now
the other aid _ humanitarian aid _ is more imminent
and so, if we'll _ if we can get that, that's fine, and then we'll take our chances on the other in trying to get it
but they do still have some military store for a limited period of time
q. if i may follow up on that point, sir, in the two plans that are being considered, the democrats want the defense department to deliver whatever stores and supplies are authorized. the republican plan would give that responsibility to the cia. do you favor either course?
a. i certainly would favor the cia
i think that involving our military when there is no need to is very rash and foolish because you would be putting our military into a combat situation and this is what we've been trying to avoid in central america all the way
q. in that regard, mr. president, i'd like to ask you about the latest hostage situation. do you think it was responsible for your administration to allow a marine lieutenant colonel, william higgins, to operate in southern lebanon at a time when eight americans were already being held in that country and when your own state department was recommending against travel there _ and, considering the ramifications of the abduction of william buckley earlier?
a. i don't think that you can use that as a measure of where officers can be assigned to duty
they're in a dangerous business to begin with, and this _ we are a part of the united nations and we have obligations to the u.n. with regard to the unifil force that has been there for a number of years now, and this particular officer happened to volunteer when there was a vacancy at that spot _ volunteered for that
and i think we have to have the confidence _ and i do have the confidence in men like him that someone would have a hard time getting secrets that could harm this country from a person of that kind
q. mr. president?
a. no, i was _
q. mr. president, to follow up on bill's question earlier, democratic national chairman paul kirk this morning called your administration the sleaziest and most corrupt in recent american history. even if you have full confidence in people like ed meese, that they will be cleared, do you have any concern that all these charges and all these investigations are going to be used effectively by the democrats against all the republican candidates in 1988?
a. i don't know whether they're going to be used effectively or not
i know they're going to be used; they have been for quite some considerable time now
as a matter of fact, if anyone listened for more than 15 minutes to their candidates, he would decide that we're in an economic slump, we're burdened by inflation, high interest rates and unemployment, when, at the moment, none of those things are true
and we have a higher percentage of our potential employee pool employed than ever in our history, and are continuing the longest expansion, economic expansion in our history
and tomorrow morning, i think you'll find a little good news, along about 8:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, is going to be released with regard to the economy
so i just think that, you know, the kids will play _ (laughter) _ and as long as they want to do that, but i hope it'll easily be forgotten
q. mr. president, the budget that you have proposed to congress would cut _ would eliminate three housing programs for the homeless. it would make deep cuts in an emergency food program, and it would end a job training program for the homeless. do you believe that the problem of the homeless is less pressing now than just a year ago when you signed legislation from congress to create these programs?
a. no, but i do know that we're doing a great many things and we also are keeping track of the extent to which the private sector is joining in and helping on this, and this budget is the result of long, long weeks of negotiation with the democrats and ourselves, and i think that we're meeting the problems
again, i also have to say this _ that sometimes, our budget in programs can reflect another program we've had going, which is a management program, and we have had a team for a considerable period of time now that has been actually investigating the management practices of government programs as compared to the way they're done in the private sector
and there are millions and millions of dollars that are being saved so that something that maybe looks smaller does not mean that the people in need are going to get less, it means that we're able to provide that with less administrative overhead
when i came here from a governorship, as a governor, i had seen federal programs administered in our state in which it was costing the federal government $2 for every dollar that reached a needy person
this is something we've been trying to change, and we've made some progress in it
q. mr. president, just to follow up on the budget, the chairman of your council of economic advisers told us last week that the deficit might have a good side if it forces your successor and congress to make choices in social programs _ do you _ is that _ do you see a good side to the deficit?
a. i have said that i think that there is a great reform that is needed throughout many of those programs, and it is a reform to where we can get these programs to where their goal will be to remove people from dependency and make them independent of government help instead of doing what we've been doing for too many years now, and that is, actually involving them in dependency to the place where they never can get out _ we've made them permanently dependent on government _ and we're trying to change that, correct that
q. thank you
a. thank you, helen. i'm going to run for it now
president reagan says the nicaraguan government, emboldened by house rejection of more aid to the contra rebels, now appears determined to ``crush its opposition and threaten its neighbors.''
at a news conference wednesday night, reagan said the house rejection of his $36.2 million contra aid proposal removed the pressure on the sandinistas and encouraged them to reject a cease-fire proposal offered by a mediator during peace talks in guatemala city
in addition, he said that while congress was voting to withdraw support from the contras, the soviets have doubled military aid to the sandinistas this year compared with a comparable period in 1987
the nicaraguan embassy took immediate exception to reagan's allegation that the sadninstas had rebuffed the cease-fire proposal. it maintained the government had ``responded positively to the proposal, saying that it was constructive and that it had several points we could work with.''
reagan ``misstated the truth,'' said embassy spokeswoman sarali porta, accusing the administration of harboring ``a commitment to prevent the achievement of a cease-fire.''
reagan spoke shortly after rep. tony coelho, d-calif., disclosed that a vote on a ``humanitarian'' aid package for the contras, originally scheduled for today, will be postponed until next week
he said house members had asked for a delay to allow them more time to evaluate a democratic plan and a rival republican proposal
the $30.5 million democratic package included $14.6 million for food, clothing, medicine and shelter for the rebels and a like amount for medical aid for children who are victims of nicaragua's seven-year civil war
the plan's author, rep. david bonior, d-mich., said it had the tacit approval of costa rican president oscar arias, author of a central america peace initiative. coelho predicted victory for the proposal by a comfortable margin
republicans criticized the democratic plan as too weak to keep the rebels alive as a fighting force. they proposed an alternative that would keep the cia in business as the delivery agent for the aid, and give reagan a chance to trigger a guaranteed vote on further military help for the rebels sometime after may 1
the democratic plan would put responsibility for delivery of the aid in the hands of the defense department, which would presumably enlist private contractors to continue air drops to the rebels similar to those now supervised by the cia. it would bar any delivery of weapons
at his news conference, reagan expressed a strong opposition to direct deliveries by the u.s. military
you would be putting our military into a combat situation and this is what we've been trying to avoid in central america all the way,'' he said
the cease-fire proposal reagan said the sandinistas had rejected called for the contras to accept a truce in exchange for four major political concessions by the government, including unrestricted press freedom and a total, unconditional amnesty
it was not clear why reagan had said the sandinistas had rejected the proposal. on monday, the state department stopped short of making that accusation, saying only that a sandinista delay in responding to the proposal had prompted the mediator, cardinal miguel obando y bravo, to suspend the talks
on saturday, nicaraguan president daniel ortega had said the cardinal's proposal ``was not rejected.''
here are highlights of president reagan's news conference wednesday night, his first in four months:
reagan asked again for aid to the contra rebels fighting the nicaraguan government. he said the soviet union had doubled military assistance for the leftist regime in the first two months of this year over 1987 levels but provided no figures or other substantiation
the president criticized the democrats for what he called their gloom and doom statements about the economy. ``at the moment none of those things are true,'' he said
reagan said ``we've never let up and we never will'' in efforts to win freedom for american hostages in lebanon. he said if republican presidential contender pat robertson knew anything of their whereabouts, as robertson insisted he once did, it was ``very strange'' that ``he kept it to himself.''
the president confirmed anew that vice president george bush expressed reservations during the iran-contra affair, but he refused to say precisely what bush had told him
reagan said he had ``every confidence'' in the personal integrity of embattled attorney general edwin meese iii but could not comment on reports of the investigation of meese's role in a proposed middle east oil pipeline
he refused to criticize israeli action against arab protesters on the occupied west bank and gaza strip. he said he hoped israelis and arabs would ``rid themselves of old ideas and stances that cannot work'' and begin serious peace negotiations
the president said he had not decided whether to tell congress that aid should be resumed to panama. he has to certify that panama is helping in anti-drug efforts. gen. manuel noriega, panama's military leader, has been indicted on u.s. drug-trafficking charges
the effort by secretary of state george p. shultz to revive america's middle east peace campaign has been greeted by a chorus of skepticism and scorn from arab commentators
a successful visit could trigger a final effort by the outgoing reagan administration to champion arab-israeli peace talks
but shultz's tour, which begins today, seems just as likely to inflame israeli-palestinian violence in the occupied lands, where leaflets distributed last weekend called for massive protests against shultz
rarely in recent years has a ranking u.s. official on a middle east peace mission faced such universal public skepticism in the government-influenced arab press
these trips will bring no results,'' said egyptian columnist moussa sabry, who is close to president hosni mubarak
syria's state-run damascus radio branded shultz's visit ``nothing but a political airlift to rescue israel and gain time.''
an editorial in the english-language jordan times said the u.s. mission has been ``greeted throughout the middle east with a combination of skepticism and laughs.''
government officials in pro-western egypt and jordan welcomed the renewed u.s. interest in middle east peace, spurred by 11 weeks of israeli-palestinian clashes in which more than 60 palestinians have been killed
but jordan's king hussein, increasingly disillusioned with american policy over the last two years, has not announced plans to meet shultz in amman
however, the two could meet in london next week on shultz's way back to washington. hussein is considered indispensable to any u.s. plan to end the 40-year-old arab-israeli conflict
arab leaders generally have become increasingly despondent about u.s. efforts following the failure of a string of american missions to the region in the last decade
mubarak warned that the u.s. proposals ``must stay away from any words or provisions that were in the camp david agreements'' signed by egypt, israel and the united states in 1978
hard-line arab states have made it clear they oppose any partial solutions, such as those the americans have in mind
the u.s. suggestions leaked so far resemble a juiced-up camp david: a period of limited self-government for palestinians in the israeli-occupied west bank and gaza strip followed by talks on a final settlement
the arab world is exhilarated by what palestinians call ``the uprising'' and palestinians are in no mood to compromise on their demand for some form of statehood _ a status no formal american or israeli plan has conceded
the essential quality of the national rights of the palestinians ... is not up for bargaining, negotiations or compromise,'' wrote jordan times editor rami khouri
the americans have not formally announced their ideas, but what is known so far leaves some room for negotiation
there is no word of conditions for talks on a final settlement, supposed to start by december. u.s. officials have not defined the international conference they say could launch arab-israeli talks in april
arab states insist on a conference attended by all parties to the conflict, as well as the five permanent members of the u.n. security council, and talks aimed at a final _ not interim _ solution
but shultz's ability to compromise is limited by washington's ally, israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir, who resists calls to accelerate the camp david process or to surrender the occupied territories, a universal arab demand
the palestinian unrest has reasserted the palestine liberation organization's role as their spokesman, damaging u.s. and israeli efforts to find ``alternative'' palestinian leaders to talk with
the growth in plo prestige occurs just as the united states is trying to defy the united nations by forcing closure of the plo mission to the world body in new york
the plo returned the american snubs by ordering palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip to boycott the shultz visit, threatening to rob shultz of contact with the people at the heart of the conflict
the plo's increased strength, coupled with washington's refusal to meet with it, bolsters the middle east role of the soviet union, a staunch backer of the organization
at the same time, the shift of the conflict to one between israelis and palestinians has moved america's main arab friends, egypt and jordan, a few steps toward the sidelines
the result makes it more difficult for the americans and israelis to prevent the soviets from taking a role in any peace talks, something the united states has accepted grudgingly and shamir still rejects
john rice has covered middle east affairs since 1984 as the ap's correspondent in amman
new screening techniques to further safeguard blood donations from the aids virus are being studied by the american association of blood banks
the aabb announced wednesday that the new study was prompted by reports that ``have raised concerns about the safety of blood transfusions administered to over 4 million people in the united states annually.''
a study published feb. 25 in the new england journal of medicine traced 13 units of blood infected by the aids virus back to seven people who donated blood even though they had been recently exposed to the virus
blood banks and hospitals routinely test donated blood for the human immune virus which causes aids, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. but the hiv tests are able only to detect antibodies which may not develop until long after the exposure to the virus. the aabb said wednesday its study will test for the hiv antigen, a marker that may appear in the blood of an infected person before the antibodies
the results of this study will determine if an antigen test would be useful in detecting individuals in early stages of infection who donate blood,'' the statement said. it added that no tests for the antigen have yet been licensed
dr. paul j. schmidt, the aabb president, said current tests are ``nearly'' 99 percent sensitive, but do not detect people recently exposed to hiv
we expected that there would be some infection developing in transfusion recipients,'' he said. ``we are working on solutions to the problem of detecting persons even earlier in this infectious state, and on how to discourage them from donating blood.''
schmidt added: ``the risk from not getting a needed transfusion is infinitely greater than the risk of getting one.''
aids is a fatal disease that is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring
the federal centers for disease control estimates that at least 1,350 americans have been infected by the aids virus from transfusions of blood or blood products since 1981. about 900 patients have died
a rigorous blood-screen program now has reduced the presence of the virus in blood supplies to an estimated one unit in 50,000
as of feb. 15, aids had been diagnosed in 53,814 americans, of whom more than half, 30,158, have died, according to the cdc. no one is known to have recovered from aids
aids kills by destroying the immune system, leaving patients susceptible to a host of opportunistic infections
blood banks now screen donor candidates for aids risk factors, but the aabb said it would review these procedures to determine if they should be tightened
the aabb is the world's largest organization of blood banks and transfusion services, with 2,500 members. it accredits blood banks and transfusion services and sets standards for agencies collecting nearly half the nation's donated blood
people often grow overweight because their fuel efficient bodies are better at storing up fat than burning off calories, not because they are gluttonous slobs, according to research published today
the studies provide scientific backing for an obvious fact of life for many overweight people: they simply need less food than their svelte friends
overeating certainly may contribute to obesity, but the two reports in the new england journal of medicine demonstrate that people's metabolisms also play a crucial role
in one of the studies, researchers found that fat babies _ all of whom had overweight mothers _ were already expending less energy than other infants when they were just 3 months old
the other found that grownups with slow metabolisms put on weight much more quickly than do other people
previous studies have shown that fat people often use up relatively low amounts of calories when resting. but it was unclear whether their metabolism was low because they are fat, or whether they were they fat because their metabolism was low
the new work suggests that low metabolism causes obesity, not the other way around
it means that some people have to eat less than others to maintain their weight. it's like they always said, but nobody ever believed,'' said dr. clifton bogardus of the national institutes of health
he said he hopes the research will help convince doctors that ``everyone who is fat isn't that way just because they are gluttonous slobs. they have something wrong.''
bogardus of phoenix, ariz., was a co-author of the adult study, conducted on 221 pima indians, who have a high rate of obesity. the researchers measured their subjects' energy expenditure while resting and while living for 24 hours in a small room
they found that those whose 24-hour energy expenditure was low were four times more likely than those with high metabolisms to gain at least 17 pounds during the following two years. they also found that low and high metabolisms tend to run in families
in the infant study, doctors studied six babies who were born to lean mothers and 12 born to overweight women. they used a newly developed urine test called the doubly labeled water method to measure the infants' energy expenditure while living at home
at 3 months, all of the babies were normal sized. but by age 1, six of the fat mothers' babies had become overweight. total energy expenditure at 3 months was 21 percent lower in the infants who later became fat
the researchers theorize that these babies have an inherited tendency to be fat. their bodies have a high ``set point,'' or weight goal. they try to reach this point by taking in more energy or using up less
the study's director, dr. susan b. roberts of massachusetts institute of technology, said she believes that the fat babies ate no more than the normal ones. they therefore put on weight to reach their set point by being less active
that would be a logical thing to do in small infants, because their food intake is largely controlled by their mothers, so they didn't have the option of going to the fridge and having another sandwich,'' she said. ``but in adults, who have the option of going to the fridge, high food intake may also contribute to the maintenance of being overweight.''
dr. william i. bennett, a diet expert at harvard medical school, said, ``what's being shown here is that there is some broad pattern of vulnerability to weight gain. they are starting to get awfully close to showing that there is a set of genes'' that controls obesity
the government has been overcharged more than $1 billion for development of the stealth bomber, according to a lawsuit against northrop corp., the company building the secret plane
the lawsuit was filed wednesday in u.s. district court here on behalf of four current and former northrop employees who could collect part of any damages awarded to the government if the suit were successful
the lawsuit, which was sealed under procedures followed in such cases, accuses northrop of double-billing, false billing and misrepresented charges, said robert kilborne, the attorney representing the employees
northrop spokesman tony cantafio refused comment, citing a company policy against responding publicly to lawsuits
the air force office of special investitations has launched its own investigation into the allegations, a standard step in such cases, said maj. kathleen mccollom, a spokeswoman for the office
kilborne refused to reveal the names of his clients, identifying them only as an internal auditor, a former controller, a former avionics engineer and a former test equipment engineer
the lawsuit alleges that northrop destroyed internal audits that turned up evidence of improper charges on development of the bomber
the plane, dubbed stealth because it is designed to be difficult to detect on enemy radar, is under development at the company's plants in pico rivera and palmdale
the audit documented $400 million in overcharges and estimated those charges amounted to $1 billion by 1987, kilborne said
the los angeles times reported in today's editions the overcharges alleged in the lawsuit amount to more than $2 billion
the lawsuit was brought under the federal false claims act, which allows citizens to sue on behalf of the government and share in any damage award. the justice department must join in the suit for it to go forward, and the suit remains sealed up to 60 days while that decision is made
it was filed by kilborne, who with his law partner, herbert hafif of claremont has brought three other such suits against northrop in connection with its work on the mx missile program. in october, the justice department moved to dismiss one of those suits after failing to substantiate the allegations
here are some facts and figures on south korea:
the land _ a small, mountainous country about the size of indiana or england, south korea occupies the southern half of the korean peninsula jutting out into the sea of japan and the yellow sea. its only border is with north korea, but it is ringed by nearby china, the soviet union and japan. the country of 41 million people has hot humid summers and very cold winters
government _ south korea is a republic with a strong presidential system under which the presidency iniates most government programs and the prime minister and cabinet ministers traditionally have had little power. the unicameral national assembly is playing a growing role
history _ korea's history can be traced to at least the 1st century b.c. small, rival kingdoms fought for control of the korean peninsula over the centuries, with china often dominating the area. japan seized the country in 1910 and proclaimed it a province
u.s. and soviet forces ended the harsh japanese colonial occupation in 1945, dividing the country along the 38th parallel. south korea and north korea were formed and the two nations fought the korean war when the communist north invaded in 1950. forces from the united states and other nations intervened on the side of the south as china sent troops to fight with the north and the soviet union provided supplies
south korea and north korea remain bitter enemies with hundreds of thousands of troops poised along their border. about 40,000 u.s. troops remain in the south under a mutual defense pact
economy _ the export-fueled economy has helped transform south korea into one of the economic powers of asia and allowed it to make a remarkable recovery from the devastation of the korean war. south korea exports a wide range of electronic goods, automobiles, ships, textiles and clothing. its main export market is the united states. contests</head>
to home-state backers, sen. paul simon's decision to forgo a big super tuesday push has an important virtue _ it beats seeing him drop out
simon advocates in illinois contacted wednesday lauded simon's decision to stay in the race following disappointing showings in the latest contests
the illinois senator announced his new strategy in washington, saying that because of a lack of campaign money, there was little he could do in the 20 states that vote on super tuesday, march 8
he is on the ballot in all the super tuesday primaries, but he said he will do little or no campaigning in those states _ except for the nationally televised debates that are a major feature of the next two weeks
and, of course, he'll have a big edge in the illinois primary, which is a week after super tuesday
simon, meeting here with about 150 supporters, many of them delegate candidates and elected officials, offered assurances that he's in the race to stay
so, there is no misunderstanding, i am on the ballot in every state. we are in every district, and we are going to contest and fight for every delegate and every vote,'' simon said to cheers and whistles
some of simon's democratic rivals suggested that a candidate who's not campaigning in the super tuesday contests poses little threat
i have always believed that to win the nomination and to ultimately win the presidency you can't have a regional strategy and you can't run in just one part of the country and not others,'' said rep. richard gephardt
and tennessee sen. albert gore, who is concentrating on the southern states, was asked whether any contender could afford to sit out super tuesday
no,'' he said
simon's backers were undaunted, though
we urged him to take a midwestern industrial strategy,'' said state sen. vince demuzio, d-carlinville, state democratic chairman
some supporters held out hope that simon still has a chance to win the democratic nomination for president despite the lack of a first-place finish in any of the early primaries and caucuses
others said simon has leverage to fashion the party ticket in case there is no clear winner by the beginning of the democratic national convention in atlanta _ leverage that would be lost if simon were to drop out now
simon himself cited ``growing evidence that for the first time in recent history there will be no first-ballot winner at the democratic convention.''
one delegate candidate, state sen. patrick welch, d-peru, also said some politicians in illinois, seeking to be simon delegates but facing their own races for offices from the county to state legislative levels, don't want to be embarrassed with losses in the delegate races
his (simon's) campaign recruited a lot of elected individuals to use their political operations to get simon elected,'' welch said. ``this works both ways.''
simon also acknowledged he has had some pressure from illinois delegate candidates to stay in the race so they could get to the convention
there are people in illinois who want to go to the convention and who are simon delegates,'' he said at a news conference. but, he said, ``this is not just an illinois strategy. it is a strategy to win.''
state sen. dawn clark netsch, d-chicago, said she is among candidates for simon-committed delegates who were dismayed when simon announced, after a third-place showing in new hampshire, that he would drop out of the race if he did not win in either minnesota or south dakota. he later took back that statement and placed fourth in both races tuesday
simon came in second in iowa's feb. 8 caucuses and third in new hampshire's feb. 16 primary
mrs. netsch said she knew of no delegate candidate whose only concern was getting to the convention
there may be some individuals who feel that way,'' she said, but ``i can't imagine someone who is angry or upset only because their ticket to the convention has gone down the drain.''
sen. alan dixon, d-ill., said he had counseled simon not to waste resources in the super tuesday states
whatever he gets (in delegates on) super tuesday, fine, but don't spend any money,'' dixon said
i firmly believe that he'll run first in illinois,'' dixon said. ``he'll pick up a large bloc of delegates there, and i think that will give him a bump _ the kind of a bump that (rep. richard) gephardt got coming out of iowa.''
rep. lane evans, d-ill., said simon's support may have waned but is still deep. simon's campaign plunged into debt before the new hampshire primary, but he has collected close to half a million dollars in the past two weeks
a judge deliberated on the 65-year-old puzzle of president warren g. harding's untimely death before concluding, ``it's a mystery to me.''
the ``ruling'' by judge george t. choppelas came after an uproarious session wednesday of the mock court of historical review, which considered suggestions that harding's wife killed him in 1923
but the ``spirit'' of harding's widow, testifying in a standing-room-only city hall courtroom, said ``madame x,'' her fortuneteller, told her that vice president calvin coolidge killed the 29th president
it was the 50th session of the just-for-fun court that since 1975 has taken up such weighty questions as ``who invented the fortune cookie?'' and ``is chicken soup jewish penicillin?''
harding, whose administration was torn apart by such corruption scandals as teapot dome, died at age 57 on aug. 2, 1923, in san francisco's palace hotel. no autopsy was performed, and his body was whisked back to washington for burial
attorney frank winston, arguing that florence harding killed her husband, opened by ordering the courtroom to pay no attention to his opponent, u.s. attorney joseph p. russoniello
we'll set the record straight,'' snarled winston, drawing snorts of derision from russoniello
hmmm,'' said the judge, raising an eyebrow
i stand for truth, justice and the american way!'' announced the government prosecutor
history can be tedious at times,'' sighed choppelas, a municipal court judge
russoniello, arguing that the widow did not kill her husband, claimed mrs. harding hated coolidge and would hardly have done anything to speed him into the presidency
coolidge was ``a scoundrel,'' testified the ``widow,'' played by attorney diane elan wick, president of the lawyers club of san francisco
police chief frank jordan, who was ``sworn in'' and promised to testify truthfully ``to the limit of my instability,'' affirmed that local officials did not investigate harding's death
it's a mystery to me,'' choppelas concluded
the tokyo stock exchange's key nikkei average closed above the 25,000-point level for the first time since the october stock crash today, while the dollar rose marginally against the japanese yen
the 225-share nikkei stock average rose 132.01 points, or 0.50 percent, in active trading to finish the day at 25,100.66
sato yamashita of goldman sachs in tokyo said the market was upbeat, although there was no special driving force behind its rally
it's generating its own momentum,'' he said
last october, on the day after a plunge of more than 500 points in wall street's dow jones industrial average, the nikkei index fell more than 3,800 points, from 25,746.56 to 21,910.08
on tokyo's foreign exchange market today the dollar closed at 128.80 yen, up a slight 0.05 yen from its close on wednesday. spot volume totaled $13.3 billion
a dealer at a major commercial bank in tokyo said wednesday's release of fourth-quarter u.s. trade figures showing that the nation's trade deficit had declined from the previous quarter had no major effect on the tokyo market
everyone's just ignoring the report,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity
the u.s. foreign trade deficit stood at $40.2 billion for the october-december 1987 quarter, down $200 million from the july-september period, u.s. commerce officials said wednesday. the trade deficit with japan, however, increased by $1.3 billion dollars to $15 billion dollars
bob dole is playing catch-up in south carolina and it helps to talk textiles and tobacco and have strom thurmond at his side
hopping from airport to airport on wednesday, dole was battling to become competitive in a state where vice president george bush and former television evangelist pat robertson were conceded to have a large lead
in the battle for the 1988 republican presidential nomination, south carolina has a unique role. its primary is march 5, three days before super tuesday when republican voters in 17 states will express their presidential choices in primaries or caucuses
the threshold to super tuesday,'' was how the kansas senator referred to south carolina at columbia, his first stop
each of dole's four stops followed the same pattern
first, his state campaign chairman introduced thurmond, the state's senior senator
in the beginning, i thought i'd remain neutral,'' said thurmond, describing all the republican candidates as ``friends of mine.''
but, he went on, ``people came to me and wanted to know where i stood.''
so this week he announced he was supporting dole
thurmond called dole ``the head man among the republicans in the senate,'' a man who rose from humble beginnings, the son of hard-working parents
in other words,'' he told people crowded into the florence airport ``they're not of the so-called elite, they weren't born with silver spoons in their mouths.'' that's the kind of reference dole often uses to contrast his background to that of bush
thurmond found other, more practical aspects of dole's background to recommend the kansan to south carolina voters
bob dole supported the textile bill,'' said thurmond, pointing out that 300,000 textile industry jobs across the country had been lost to foreign competition and that 126 textile plants had closed in south carolina
the south carolina senator said that 45 percent of the jobs in his state were in the textile industry
the legislation he referred to would limit imports
we have a textile bill up now,'' he said ``and he (dole) is obligated _ not obligated _ he has promised to support that and we are proud of that.''
as republican leader of the senate, dole can play a significant role in determining whether textile import legislation can come to a vote in congress, certainly more of a role than bush or robertson could hope to play
florence also is tobacco country and dole was asked his view on tobacco subsidies
he talked about his role in passage of the current subsidy program which he described as operating at no cost to the taxpayers
a lot of people think, why are you subsidizing tobacco,'' he said
those people are farmers, too,'' he went on ``and they've got a right to, make a living. i've supported the tobacco program in every vote since i've been in congress and i'm going to continue to do so.''
to guarantee the comfort of secretary of state george p. shultz, the holy city saved him the best hotel room in town, stocked up on exotic fruits and made him chocolates shaped like the dove of peace
a white sculpture of a dove with a 12-foot wing span hangs in the lobby of hilton hotel where the secretary will stay
when he arrives today for a five-day middle east shuttle to launch a new peace initiative, shultz will occupy the 20th floor royal suite in the hotel, which dominates the northwestern outskirts of jerusalem. his entourage will fill about 160 rooms, hotel officials said
when you open the doors leading to the balcony, you see really a stunning view of jerusalem, with the whole old city spread before you,'' alon ben-gurion, the hotel's deputy manager, told israel's army radio
dina doron, who will be responsible for the reception, said the rooms have been decorated with orchids and other plants
ben-gurion said a cook ``was flown from germany especially for the occasion to make some sweets, chocolates in the form of doves.''
shultz ... likes very much seafood, and he usually tries local dishes, so we brought a selection of mediterranean fish. he also likes beer, and usually drinks local beer. during his last visit he drank (israeli) maccabee beer,'' he said
and, of course, the local fruits, all the exotic fruits that we have today in israel, like strawberries, kiwi, and oranges,'' ben-gurion added
the army radio reported that the hotel's pool has been heated to the temperature of 79 degrees preferred by shultz and that several couples have been invited to play tennis with the secretary of state
but other sights shultz is likely to encounter in jerusalem are bound to be less peaceful
airport police said special riot units were called in and will stay on duty through tuesday as shultz conducts his mission
jerusalem's police force was doubled to 3,000 to forestall palestinian protests during the shultz visit, said city spokeswoman sivana meryn
an army spokesman said israeli police approached the army with a request for extra manpower in jerusalem and the military agreed. in the mixed arab-jewish abu tor neighborhood, troops were seen checking the identities of arab teen-agers
it was apparently the first time troops were used in the holy city since israel united it after capturing the arab east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 middle east war
the space shuttle program took another step toward america's return to space with the apparently successful fourth test of a joint on the redesigned booster rocket, a nasa official says
flaws deliberately built into the nozzle-to-case joint for wednesday's test allowed hot gases to reach the joint's primary o-ring seal. but the o-ring stopped the gases from reaching the secondary or final seal, said royce mitchell, nasa solid rocket motor manager
it will prove that we can give up two of our seals, or two of our lines of defense against this hot gas, and still have a good, safe motor,'' mitchell said following the six-second test at morton thiokol inc.'s wasatch operations plant 25 miles west of here
all indications are it's a good test, but we've got another couple of these to go and, of course, our next motor test will be in april,'' mitchell said, adding that a complete analysis of the joint's performance was not expected for several weeks
the solid-fuel rocket booster has undergone extensive redesign since the jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle challenger that killed the seven-member crew. the disaster was blamed on a faulty seal in a booster joint that allowed hot gases to escape and ignite the fuel tank
wednesday's test, delayed two hours by replacement of a computer board, was the fourth of six nozzle joint environment simulator experiments and one of hundreds of booster component tests
the initially favorable results showed the shuttle program is moving slowly but surely toward resumption of flights, mitchell said
we are maintaining our schedule for the august launch of discovery,'' he said. ``it's a very conservative approach.''
the test was designed to evaluate the main seal's ability to contain any gases that might leak through bonded adhesive insulation and a rubber-like ``wiper'' o-ring during launch, said thiokol spokesman rocky raab
engineers made a quarter-inch-by-five-hundredths-inch hole through the insulation and disabled the wiper ring, creating two flaws that assured a gas path to the primary seal
the double defects simulated coincidental manufacturing defects in the insulation and wiper o-ring, a ``worst possible case'' that likely could never occur, raab said. it also subjected the joint to more severe conditions than previous tests
the next test will increase the pressure because the primary o-ring will be purposely flawed to permit gases to reach the secondary o-ring, mitchell said. the final test will simulate complete failure
engineers concluded after the third nozzle-joint test oct. 8 that the o-ring system withstood gas pressure after a single flaw was built into the joint, which connects the nozzle to the body of the segmented booster rocket
however, during a full-scale test dec. 23, a ``blow hole'' was detected in the joint's adhesive sealant, a defect nasa had not built into the test
blow holes can occur during assembly of the 126-foot-long rocket, ``so it happens here at the factory, if it happens,'' raab said
while the blow hole was not considered a major problem, the failure of a nozzle boot ring during the december test prompted nasa officials to delay the scheduled june 2 resumption of shuttle flights
raab said the test wednesday simulated ``the most difficult portion of the environment for the o-rings, that is the first one second'' of launch
in addition to the final two nozzle-to-case tests scheduled before shuttle flights resume, nasa and thiokol will conduct several more joint environment simulator tests of the booster rocket and three more full-scale horizontal tests, in april, june and july
the birth control device known as the cervical cap appears headed for regulatory approval after seven years of testing
the device, already used by women in great britain and several other countries, received the green light wednesday by the food and drug administration's obstetrics-gynecology devices advisory panel
the unanimous recommendation was non-binding, but the fda usually follows the advice of such panels of outside experts it maintains to help assess clinical studies
the cervical cap is medically similar to the diaphragms already used by an estimated 3 million u.s. women, but it was not widely used in the united states in 1977 when congress ordered fda to strengthen its regulation of birth control and other medical devices
diaphragms and condoms were given ``grandfather'' fda approval at that time without the stringent testing subsequently required of new medical devices
in the testing financed by the national institutes of health, the cap has been available to about 50,000 women in 29 states and the district of columbia
rather than covering the entire roof of the vagina as a diaphragm does, the cap fits over the tip of the cervix and thus allows for more sensitivity during intercourse
another advantage is that it can remain in place longer than the diaphragm without additional application of spermicide, which is recommended for use with the cap as it is with the diaphragm
although many women typically wore the cap for three days at a time in the clinical trials, the panel decided to recommend that it remain in place no longer than two days at a time. similar recommendations for the diaphragm say it should not stay in place more than 24 hours
the cap was found to be 94.6 percent effective in preventing pregnancy when worn for every instance of intercourse compared to 96.4 percent for the diaphragm
survey forms on which doctors admitted helping with mercy killings of terminally ill patients have been burned to protect the doctors from possible criminal prosecution, a ``right-to-die'' group said
the survey responses, including 20 signed forms from doctors who said they had helped patients, were destroyed because of a ``witch hunt'' for a doctor who described a mercy killing in a medical journal, said derek humphry, executive director of the hemlock society
some people have noticed evidence buried in the survey of what i would call compassionate crimes,'' humphry said tuesday. ``we decided to destroy the evidence before there is any official inquiry, and therefore not break any law. we would not want to get these kindly doctors into trouble.''
the society, which promotes euthanasia, or mercy killing, last week released results of the survey showing 51 percent of california doctors responding would practice euthanasia where they considered it appropriate
asked if they had ever helped a patient die, 79 of 588 doctors responded positively, and 20 of those put their names on their responses, humphrey said. of those doctors who had taken the life of a patient, 15 said they had done it once, 35 said they had done it two or three times and 29 said they had done it more than three times, he said
the society's news release didn't describe how the doctors surveyed were selected or how representative they are
humphry said concern over possible prosecution was prompted by calls for criminal charges against a doctor who wrote anonymously in the jan. 8 issue of the journal of the american medical association of a mercy killing
the letter to the editor, titled ``it's over, debbie,'' prompted calls for prosecution from new york mayor edward koch among others. the district attorney in cook county, ill., where the journal is published, is seeking the name of the letter writer, but the journal has resisted
the hemlock society, which claims 23,000 members, is based in los angeles
violent palestinian riots have spilled onto canvas and into lyrics as many israeli artists and intellectuals rebel against government policy in the occupied territories
the intellectual rebellion has galvanized the dovish camp but so far has had no noticeable effect on the middle-of-the road voter whose support will determine what path israel follows in the peace process in elections this november
one hundred writers, actors, singers and other well-known figures in the arts published an advertisement in israeli newspapers last week calling for an end to army brutality against the palestinians
on saturday, more than 100 artists and photographers are scheduled to take part in a protest exhibition, many of them displaying works made since the unrest broke out
it is not as much the occupation that worries me as what has happened to us,'' said nira yitzhaki, an art gallery owner who is organizing the exhibition. ``we have lost our humanity.''
six art galleries will host the show under the banner: ``we favor immediate talks with the palestinians and an end to the occupation.''
representatives of more than 10 groups of writers, playwrights, students and university academics are co-ordinating a protest campaign
playwrights are mounting a vigil outside prime minister yitzhak shamir's home, calling for negotiations with palestinian leaders
a growing number of israelis in the arts, many of them leaders in their fields, have started to protest the 20-year-long occupation and the harsh army crackdown on palestinian demonstrators
according to u.n. figures, more than 60 palestinians have been killed since violence began dec. 8 in the occupied west bank and gaza strip, which israel captured from jordan and egypt during the 1967 middle east war
some of the more popular entertainers could be putting their careers on the line by taking sides in israel's highly polarized and emotional debate
among them is cee heiman, an up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer who recently cut her first record
during an appearance last saturday at an avant-garde theatre run by the left-wing mapam party, heiman sang the first israeli protest song of the current palestinian uprising
the song, ``shooting and crying,'' has some tough lyrics
the window in my home is broken and tel aviv rushes in,'' sang heiman. ``even its smell has changed. boys play with lead and girls with dolls of steel. life looks different in the shadow of the filth.''
we shoot and cry, laugh and burn. whenever did we learn how to bury people alive. we shoot and cry, laugh and burn. when did we forget there was a time our children were also killed.''
but aharon appelfeld, a holocaust survivor and one of israel's internationally known writers, said the intellectuals are contributing to the discord which is ripping israeli society apart
instead of being a moderating influence, the intellectuals are adding to the extremism,'' he said in an interview. ``i'm very afraid of the polarization and they keep fanning the flames.''
appelfeld, author of such books as ``badenheim, 1939'' and ``the age of wonders'' said he agreed israel should not rule over the palestinians but disliked the way the intellectuals were presenting their arguments
they are saying that in the present situation the arabs are the good guys and the jews the bad ones,'' he said. ``the arabs want to negotiate with us and we don't want to. but this is not true
most israelis feel that the arabs still do not accept us in this region,'' appelfeld said. ``we want to hear voices from the other side telling us we are welcome, telling us they won't throw us into the sea.''
he warned that the arguments used by israeli intellectuals were alienating the silent majority of israelis who strive for peace but have genuine and legitimate concerns
the mainly ashkenazi (european-origin) intellectuals have not found a way to reach the religious community or the sephardis (who come from arabic-speaking countries),'' appelfeld said. ``they are not rabble. they are people with genuine fears and they must be understood.''
i am very afraid that two large camps may be formed which could reach the point of civil war,'' said appelfeld. ``it's our job not to light that fire. that's a heavy responsibility.''
david walter says customers will have to wade for a table at the restaurant he hopes to moor off this gulf coast resort
walter has applied to the u.s. army corps of engineers for a permit allowing him to moor a 50-foot-long oil field jack-up boat converted into a restaurant and bar
the restaurant would sit in the surf within 50 feet of the beach in about 3 feet of water, he said recently
the eatery would be jacked up on four legs and would face the beach. customers would wade through the water and walk up a ramp to enter the restaurant
you have to wear something you can get wet,'' walter said. shoes aren't required
walter said he expects his customers to be ``the bathing suit people'' who lie on the beach, and hopes to do business from may 15 to sept. 15
he said the restaurant initially won't be open at night for safety reasons. he also has yet to work out a menu, but said the food will be ``nothing elaborate.''
if the establishment is not successful, walter said, he can just ``push two levers and move the boat off and drive away.''
no posie tweets from the bright lights allowed
in ``boontling'' dialect, that means no flower children from a big city will be accepted in the four- to eight-week course in boontling that will be offered this summer to children in boonville
jack june, a 65-year resident of boonville, is one of about a dozen ``true literates'' of the unusual dialect spoken only in the little village about 180 miles north of san francisco
i'd like to see it (the course), but not if it's half-eesled. if it's half-eesled, just shy it. does more harm than good,'' june said
half eesled,'' loosely translated, means ``half-baked.''
the mendocino county convention and visitors' bureau has approved a $1,000 grant to be used as seed money for the pilot program
officials said the boontling program may blossom into a prototype for eventual use in addition to english in boonville schools
soviet soldiers have started loading shorter-range ss-12 nuclear missiles onto railroad cars in preparation for the rockets' removal from czechoslovakia, the official news agency said today
the loading was taking place in the moravian town of hranice, the news agency ctk added
according to the report, the missiles were transported during the night from a nearby military zone to the railway station where the loading operation began
czechoslovakia announced wednesday that the soviet rockets would be removed before the u.s. congress votes on ratification of the superpowers' missile treaty signed last december in washington
ctk added that the first of the missiles would leave hranice for the soviet union this evening
foreign ministry spokesman dusan rovensky said wednesday evening that under an agreement between czechoslovakia and the soviet union, ``the withdrawal of soviet army rocket units armed with operational-tactical missiles from czechoslovak territory will start on feb. 25.''
ctk said the removal of the soviet missiles was being watched by 60 reporters, but it was not known if any western journalists were invited
a farewell meeting between hranice citizens and soviet soldiers was scheduled for the afternoon, ctk noted
hranice, with a population of 12,500, has been singled out by czechoslovak officials as the only place in the country where soviet missiles had been stationed
the step of the soviet government, the removal of operational-tactical shorter-range missiles before ratification of the soviet-american agreement, is further proof of the sincerity, concreteness and constructive approach of the soviet peace policy to nuclear disarmament and the creation of a more secure world,'' ctk said
the withdrawal coincides with the 40th anniversary of communist rule in czechoslovakia
communist party leader milos jakes condemned the social reforms that were crushed by soviet-led troops 20 years ago, and said the nation will maintain central planning of the economy
speaking at a celebration wednesday marking the 40th anniversary of the communist takeover in czechoslovakia, jakes gave little indication he is about to favor economic and political reforms similar to those being tried in the soviet union, poland, hungary and bulgaria
the 65-year-old jakes also ruled out all non-communist opposition
jakes took over party leadership last december from gustav husak, now 75, who was chairman of the solemn meeting on wednesday
jakes' hourlong speech to 500 party members in prague's hradcany castle did not essentially differ from the cautious conservatism husak displayed during his 18-year tenure
the speech preceded celebrations that will include a mass rally today in prague's old town square, scene of a triumphant speech by then-communist party leader klement gottwald on feb. 21, 1948
jakes asserted that an economic restructuring process was under way concerning ``a new framework of the sphere of action for central bodies.''
but he hastened to add, ``these measures are in no way meant as steps toward weakening the role of the centrally managed economy.''
he revealed that part of the ministerial bureaucracy will be reassigned to productive work, and, in an apparent allusion to reform-minded neighboring hungary, said: ``there is no threat of unemployment in czechoslovakia.''
jakes attacked the communists who, under the leadership of alexander dubcek, tried in 1968 to introduce some reforms resembling those recently instituted or proposed by mikhail s. gorbachev in the soviet union
as head of the party's chief disciplinary body from 1968 to 1977, jakes was responsible for purging 500,000 people from the communist party after the invasion. jakes denied there is a need to reassess the official view of 1968
he also rejected any comparison between dubcek's reforms and gorbachev's innovations. the party chief lauded the ``assistance'' czechoslovakia received from the soviet union and its allies to obliterate dubcek's reform efforts
the communists received nearly 40 percent of the vote in elections in 1946, but assumed sole power only after a series of political maneuvers from feb. 20-25, 1948. czechoslovakia was the last country in eastern europe to turn communist, setting the seal on kremlin domination of the region
it was no communist coup, as it's always described by hostile propaganda,'' jakes said of the 1948 takeover. ``it was the will of the people.''
he also issued a warning to the charter 77 human rights movement and other non-conformists who are banned from public life in czechoslovakia
the broadening of democratization in no case means the creation of space for the legalization of political opposition which, as all experiences to date show, cannot be other than anti-socialist,'' said jakes
rock 'n' roll singer frank zappa has pledged to register fans at his concert here tonight to vote, and the league of women voters couldn't be happier
the alliance prompted one elderly league member to joke that he would turn down the volume on his hearing aid during the concert, said pittsburgh league president marsha bingler
i consider that an upbeat comment,'' said ms. bingler. ``the gentleman who said that is about 70 years old. he does have trouble with his hearing
i've had no one in the league say anything other than that this is a worthwhile effort,'' she said. ``the league encourages the widest participation in the electoral process.''
zappa said 400 people registered at his recent concert in boston, and about 380 registered at a stop in hartford, conn
the only way to change what is going on is to vote,'' he said. ``unless young people get involved, their decisions will be made by people older than them who don't know or don't care.'' heptachlor</head>
a federal judge has told the environmental protection agency it has until april 15 to ban the sale and commercial use of products containing an anti-termite pesticide believed to cause cancer
u.s. district judge louis oberdorfer ruled wednesday that the epa had acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federal pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of products containing the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor
oberdorfer said the epa failed to take into account whether continued sale or use of the products ``would pose any unreasonable risk to man or the environment.''
last year, velsicol chemical corp., the nation's only manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, agreed to stop selling the chemical while it tries to find an acceptable method of applying the pesticide
but the epa's agreement with velsicol did not cover products containing chlordane made by other companies for the retail market
the agency estimates these companies have 1,700 pounds of chlordane products in their stocks compared with the 110,000 pounds in velsicol's inventory
a federally imposed waiting period for would-be gun buyers would save lives by letting violence-prone customers cool down, say olice officials
representatives of national, state and local police wednesday urged the house judiciary subcommitee on crime to advance legislation requiring a waiting period after any request to buy a handgun
the crime panel is considering a number of bills that would require a delay of at least seven days between the time a buyer enters a gun store and when the customer gets the weapon
also under consideration are plans to require background checks of would-be buyers, including comparison of their fingerprints to fbi records
both ideas were strongly opposed by pro-gun groups and some members of congress as ineffective against violent crimes and unfair to legitimate gun buyers. the national rifle association called the plan ``irrelevant, useless, costly and unconstitutional.''
up to 1 million taxpayers will receive federal refunds as much as three weeks earlier this year by having a professional file their tax returns directly into the irs computer
already this year, 119,494 returns have been filed electronically _ compared with 77,612 for the entire filing season in 1987. if the taxpayers choose, their refunds will be deposited directly into their bank account
although the number of electronic returns are up considerably this year, the volume of ordinary, paper returns filed so far is 6.7 percent below last year's pace. however, the gap _ which officials blame partially on the new tax law _ is closing each week
through feb. 19, the internal revenue service said wednesday, 23.55 million returns had been filed, compared with 25.24 million a year ago. the irs has processed 9.74 million of this year's returns, up slightly from 9.72 million last year
the inventory of unprocessed returns totaled 13.8 million last week, compared with 15.5 million a year ago
the average refund is bigger this year: $782 compared with $727. by the time all 107 million individual returns are filed this year, the irs estimates, nearly 80 percent will qualify for refunds averaging about $1,000
the election of a dynamic tycoon as president and a thaw in greek-turkish relations has raised hopes for a settlement of ethnic disputes on this mediterranean island
the cyprus question has long soured relations between greece and turkey, two nato allies, posing a potentially serious weakness in the atlantic alliance's vulnerable southern flank
george vassiliou, 56, a self-made millionaire, was elected cyprus' president for a five-year term feb. 21. he ran as an independent with the powerful communist party his main backer on a platform of ``time for change.''
he vowed to be flexible and work for ``quick results'' to reunite cyprus, partitioned since turkey invaded in 1974 and occupied the northern third of the island
as leader of the 500,000-strong greek cypriot majority, vassiliou has said he is prepared to meet with rauf denktash, president of the breakaway turkish cypriot republic proclaimed in the north in 1983 and recognized only by turkey
but vassiliou must overcome deep distrust and military buildups on both sides which u.n. secretary-general javier perez de cuellar has warned could trigger a new confrontation
vassiliou, a political newcomer, is widely viewed as more flexible than his predecessor, spyros kyprianou. but vassiliou remains committed to the withdrawal of some 30,000 turkish troops and 50,000 turkish settlers from the north and the return of 200,000 greek cypriot refugees
turkey and denktash insist the troops are needed to protect the 120,000 turkish cypriots
hints by the turkish government that it might be prepared to pull out some troops in advance of any agreement fueled hopes of progress
it is not clear what concessions vassiliou is prepared to make
negotiations under u.n. auspices have been deadlocked for three years because of kyprianou's hard line
kyprianou had the rug pulled from under him two weeks before the election, when greek prime minister andreas papandreou, who for years refused to negotiate with turkey, changed his mind
papandreou conferred with turkish prime minister turgut ozal in the swiss resort of davos in late january. the meeting ended with a ``no war'' agreement and an announced determination to settle all outstanding differences peacefully
apart from the cyprus problem, what has brought brought greece and turkey to the brink of war repeatedly in recent years is the issue of territorial waters and underwater oilfields in the aegean sea
greece and turkey sought to patch together a settlement of the cyprus problem in 1958 in what greek cypriots refer to as ``the ignominious, imposed zurich agreement.''
this laid the groundwork for independence from britain two years later. under that agreement, the island's constitution gave the turkish cypriot minority, 17 percent of the population, equal political status with the greek cypriots
the agreement also made britain, greece and turkey guarantor powers with the right to intervene
that is widely seen by greek cypriots as sowing the seeds for turkey's subsequent invasion on the pretext of protecting turkish cypriots after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with greece plotted with the colonels' junta then in power in athens

after a prolonged warm spell, relations between britain and ireland appear to be going into a dangerous free fall over a spate of incidents involving the conduct of british security forces in northern ireland
so severe is the strain that fears are being voiced for the survival of the 1985 anglo-irish agreement, the accord that gave dublin a say in the running of northern ireland and was responsible for the relative amity that existed between britain and ireland until the beginning of the year
the harmony was jolted on jan. 25. the british government announced that, having investigated the shooting of six unarmed roman catholics by northern ireland police in 1982, authorities uncovered evidence of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice _ yet no policemen would be prosecuted
matters grew worse the same week when a british court rejected the appeal of six irishmen who claim they were wrongly convicted of a 1974 bombing attack in mainland britain that killed 21 people
the irish government said that despite the ruling, it continued to believe a miscarriage of justice may have occurred
that dispute was quickly followed by a new one as ireland accused london of failing to abide by the conditions dublin has set for extraditing irish republican army suspects to britain
next, the british government announced it was making its tough anti-terrorism law, which requires annual parliamentary renewal, permanent. many irish believe the law tars them with the brush of the ira. only after outcry in ireland did britain restore parliament's right to review the law annually
tempers grew worse on sunday when aidan mcanespie, a 23-year-old catholic and supporter of the outlawed ira's legal political wing, sinn fein, was shot dead from an army observation tower as he was walking through a security checkpoint on the ireland-northern ireland border
the army expressed regret and the soldier who fired the shot was charged wednesday with unlawful killing
the royal ulster constabulary said it was investigating the shooting, but irish prime minister charles haughey ordered his own force to investigate, too
this outraged the british, who saw it as a gesture of disdain for the royal ulster constabulary's efforts. prime minister margaret thatcher pointedly warned the irish to keep their investigation to their own side of the border
she also voiced annoyance at dublin's behavior on the extradition issue
but then, on tuesday, the army dropped a new bombshell. it announced that pvt. ian thain, the only british soldier ever jailed for life for killing a civilian in northern ireland, was free on parole and back in his regiment, having served only three years of his term
even the conservative daily telegraph, which usually takes britain's side in disputes with britain, called it an act of ``stunning insensitivity.''
among northern ireland's catholic minority, angry reactions came not just from sinn fein militants, but from moderates like cardinal tomas o fiaich, head of ireland's roman catholic church. he called mcanespie's death ``murder,'' and said thain's release ``add insult to injury.''
a british official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the incidents were ``a spasm'' in anglo-irish relations, not a pattern. he said britain's critics were failing to take into account that the security forces in northern ireland were up against a terrorist organization in a civil war that has claimed more than 2,500 lives since 1969
but merlyn rees, a former northern ireland secretary, warned that the anglo-irish agreement was ``tottering.''
in dublin, the irish press commented: ``there is an alarming but unmistakable pattern emerging from the behavior of the british government toward our government. it is almost as if it is trying to provoke mr. haughey into a rash decision.''
so far the irish prime minister has kept cool and refrained from anti-british rhetoric. most important, perhaps, is his clear determination to carry on fighting the ira
police have uncovered several large ira arms caches north and south of the border, including one on wednesday night near dublin that contained explosives, grenades and two dozen assault rifles
the irish press editorialized that it was britain's system of justice that had alienated northern ireland's catholics and pushed some of them into the ira's embrace
it was that alienation that was supposed to be tackled by the anglo-irish agreement, the paper said, adding: ``that hope is fading by the week.''
share prices rose in early london trading today with insurance companies showing the strongest gains
the financial times-stock exchange 100 index was up 8.5 points at 1,768.6 at 9:45 a.m. when the market opened at 9 a.m., the index was up 4.2 at 1,764.3
insurance companies led the gains after royal insurance announced 1987 earnings that were generally better than market expectations. royal's pre-tax profit fell 10 percent to 274.0 million pounds in calendar 1987 from 304.8 million pounds the previous year
royal shares were up 7 pence at 408 pence. among the other insurers, general accident rose 16 to 877 and commercial union gained 10 to 330
the early trend followed a small gain in new york wednesday, where the dow jones industrial average rose 0.83 to 2,039.95, and a rise in tokyo overnight, where the nikkei index climbed 132.01 to 25,100.66
democrat mike dukakis and vice president george bush appear to be the favorites in the march 8 super tuesday primary elections and caucuses, according to the denver post-gallup poll
the poll showed dukakis as the runaway favorite in his home state of massachusetts, with 61 percent of the voters saying they favor their governor. thirteen percent said they supported richard gephardt; 7 percent sen. paul simon; 6 percent for jesse jackson; 3 percent for sen. albert gore, and 2 percent for gary hart, according to the poll
democrats in the 13 southern states holding primaries or caucuses on march 8 give dukakis 26 percent; gore 18 percent; jackson 16 percent; gephardt 12 percent; hart 11 percent and simon 6 percent, the poll results show
the poll showed that while bush still is the solid gop favorite in the south and in massachusetts, sen. bob dole has made significant gains during the past month of campaigning
bush is favored by 54 percent of the republicans most likely to vote in the southern states march 8, while dole has the backing of 33 percent the poll shows
the poll was conducted by the gallup organization of princeton, n.j., on feb. 19-21 through telephone interviews with 1729 registered republicans and democrats in the southern states, massachusetts an oklahoma
in the gop races, the poll's margin of error was plus or minus 6 percent, and in the democratic contests, the margin was 5 percent
the coordinator of gary hart's new york campaign effort says he is in a race against the clock to get the former colorado senator on new york's april 19 presidential primary ballot
it's pretty close,'' said john kaiman. ``the system itself stinks and when you have a controversial candidate ... it's almost impossible.''
hart was forced out of the presidential race for a time after it came out that he had spent a weekend in the company of miami model donna rice
to get on the new york ballot, democratic candidates have until midnight tonight to get postmarks on petitions containing the signatures of at least 10,000 registered new york democrats. at least 100 signatures must come from each of 17 of the state's 34 congressional districts
with new york sending the second largest delegations, after california, to the national conventions, the state's april 19 could be crucial to both democratic and republican candidates
problems with exit polling were reported to local and state election officials during tuesday's presidential primary, said south dakota secretary of state joyce hazeltine
there were definitely statewide problems. some exit pollsters thought that they had been mistreated,'' hazeltine said in a telephone interview
hazeltine said she was pleased with the number of people who voted
i thought it was great,'' she said of the 43 percent overall turnout
just over 45 percent of the state's 206,585 registered republicans and almost 40 percent of the 179,641 registered democrats voted tuesday
illinois sen. paul simon may have bowed out of super tuesday contention in the south, but he hasn't written off washington and will make a campaign swing here, according to state campaign organizers
but jeff smith, executive director of the washington state democratic party, said the senator's campaign moratorium could greatly dampen his chances of doing well here
simon had been seen as no. 2 presidential hopeful in washington, behind massachusetts gov. michael dukakis. but with simon downplaying super tuesday, the race is ``increasingly defined'' as a strong dukakis victory, with simon slipping, smith said
simon has scheduled campaign appearances in four washington cities early next week, and still hopes to come in no worse than a strong second in the state's march 8 caucuses, insisted state organizer beth doglio
simon announced in washington, d.c., on wednesday he is bypassing the 20-state super tuesday, mostly in the south and border states, because he was low on funds and did not see the day's caucuses as being decisive or critical
pat robertson, who fell just short of the threshold needed to win republican south dakota delegates, has asked for a recount of presidential primary votes, according to the secretary of state
robertson received 18,279 votes or 19.6 percent of the republican votes cast in tuesday's election. a candidate needed at least 20 percent of republican votes in order to receive any of south dakota's 18 delegates to the republican national convention
kansas sen. bob dole garnered 55 percent of the vote, the only republican to receive more than 20 percent
secretary of state joyce hazeltine said robertson would need 382 more votes to reach the 20 percent mark
her staff and attorney general roger tellinghuisen are reviewing south dakota statutes to see whether a recount is allowed after a primary election
a spokesman for presidential hopeful pat robertson says the former television evangelist will try to mold an ohio version of his ``invisible army'' through the registration of new voters during march
ray jeske, executive director of the republican's campaign, said wednesday the effort will include a mailings, along with direct appeals to members of about 3,000 ohio churches. ``march is going to be voter registration month,'' he said
he said there also will be training seminars and other events at which democrats will be advised how to cross over and obtain gop ballots in order to support robertson in the may 3 primary
however ohio law will require a strategy adjustment because it requires voters to register 30 days before the primary. while registrants do not declare their party affiliations up front, they later join one of the major parties by requesting its ballot at the polling place
democrats or republicans already registered on may 3, as a result of past voting, can cross over by signing a statement that they now support the principles of the other party, jeske pointed out
robertson claims strong support among democrats, who apparently have backed his campaign in other states. in iowa, for example, crossover voting, which does not require advance registration, and what robertson calls his ``invisible army'' showed up at neighborhood caucuses to help him finish second

if anyone listened for more than 15 minutes to their candidates, he would decide that we're in an economic slump, we're burdened by inflation, high interest rates and unemployment when, at the moment, none of those things are true. ... so, i just think that, you know, the kids will play, and as long as they want to do that, but i hope it'll easily be forgotten.'' _ president reagan, asked about democrats' charges that his administration has been plagued by corruption

snowshowers lingered today over the lower great lakes region and the upper ohio valley, but dry weather and clear skies prevailed for most of the rest of the nation
warnings for heavy snow remained in effect for northeastern ohio's snowbelt, where up to 11 inches of snow fell in ashtabula and lake counties by late wednesday and up to 6 inches more were expected
squalls also produced heavy snow in new york state, with more than 6 inches of snow reported in some areas. dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with fair skies in most areas
freezing temperatures prevailed early today from the northern and central high plains to the carolinas and the middle and northern atlantic coast, with readings below 20 degrees from the dakotas to new england. temperatures were in the single numbers or below zero in northern and central wisconsin, northern and central minnesota, eastern north dakota and northeastern south dakota
temperatures were in the 50s across south central texas and central florida, southern california and southern arizona, and in the 60s in southern florida
the national weather forecast for today called for snowshowers across the northern and eastern great lakes and the upper ohio valley. apart from some cloudiness over north central and southern texas, the rest of the nation should be dry with mostly sunny skies
high temperatures should be in the 40s or 50s across much of the nation; the teens across northern minnesota and the northern great lakes region; 20s and 30s from the northern plains through the upper half of the mississippi valley and the ohio valley into northern and central new england. the 60s were expected from the central pacific coast across the southern rockies, much of texas and lower mississippi valley into northern and central florida; and, the 70s from the central valleys and southern california into the desert southwest and extreme southern florida

the leaders of israel's divided coalition government today argued over how to respond to new u.s. peace proposals that will be presented during a visit by secretary of state george p. shultz
in another development, shultz today said that israel's longtime occupation _ not outside agitation _ is to blame for the violent unrest now occurring in the west bank and gaza strip
its fundamental origins are essentially indigenous,'' shultz said of the violence
he spoke to reporters traveling with him during a refueling stop in shannon, ireland. shultz was to arrive in jerusalem later today for five days of shuttle diplomacy in the middle east
shultz appeared to disagree with remarks president reagan made at a news conference in washington wednesday night. reagan said some of the violence in the occupied lands was inspired from outside. the president cited intelligence reports but gave no details
shultz said the intelligence showed ``a mixed picture'' with ``interaction with outside force.''
but, he added: ``there is an underlying problem consisting of a large number of people in occupation who haven't had the basic rights of governance. so we seek among other things consistent with israel's security, to look at things that will help palestinians gain legitimate rights.''
shultz faces a difficult task in selling his proposals because palestinians have refused to meet with him and israelis are split over how to make peace with the arabs
u.s. officials and palestinians say there is little chance shultz will meet with palestinian moderates in jerusalem because of a ban imposed by the palestine liberation organization
shultz also will have to deal with the sharp differences separating conservative prime minister yitzhak shamir and his liberal political rival, foreign minister shimon peres
speaking today on israel's armed forces radio, shamir said ongoing rioting in the occupied lands will inhibit negotiations
certainly what's happening in the west bank and gaza doesn't create the atmosphere for serious political discussions since our prime attention isn't on these efforts but on easing the situation and returning the area to a normal life,'' he said
shamir restated his opposition to an international conference to discuss peace and rejected the land-for-peace formula proposed by shultz as a basis for talks. the prime minister made it clear he would not make concessions under the the pressure of the riots or diplomatic arm-twisting by the americans
i don't think we'll surrender to pressure. and i don't think someone will be able to achieve something from pressure,'' he added
shamir said only early elections could resolve the division in israel on which direction to take in dealing with the arabs. he said such elections would be possible in july or august. but he added: ``we will try to garner from these discussions something serious that will be able to advance the peace process.''
in an interview today with israel radio, peres indirectly attacked shamir, accusing the likud bloc leader of inaction and stressing the need for arab-israeli negotiations as a way out of the dilemma in the occupied lands
i think it's wise not to create expectations, but it's not wise to ignore the need to get out of the present situation. and i think that without a peace process the situation won't improve but will get worse,'' said peres
peres warned shamir against a policy of ``doing nothing.''
in my opinion, it's a situation that causes the greatest damage to the state of israel,'' peres said. ``the attitude that nothing is burning. supporting the status quo. all of the world against us. everyone running away (from talks). where does it lead?''
he also rejected shamir's hints the november national elections should be advanced
a renewal of the peace process doesn't depend on advancing the elections. it's desirable that the elecetions be held when there's a peace process. in the final analysis, the problem is more of the state than of the parties,'' he said
without palestinian participation, the new u.s. peace plan is also unlikely to have the desired calming influence on the rioting that began dec. 8
palestinian notables said they would obey plo orders and not meet with shultz in jerusalem
as far as we are concerned, there won't be a meeting. the plo has made clear its conditions,'' said fayez abu rahme, a gaza strip lawyer
hanna siniora, a palestinian newspaper editor, said the plo has sanctioned a meeting in amman or cairo
a u.s. government source said shultz refused to meet palestinians anywhere but jerusalem. ``we are not taking directions from the plo on how to meet with palestinians,'' the source said. ``meeting outside jerusalem is a no-go.''
a principal decided to get tough and demoted 250 of her elementary school's 830 pupils because of poor reading skills, but the move outraged many parents in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods
in the third day of a school boycott, angry parents kept about 400 children out of their beethoven elementary school classrooms on wednesday to protest the midyear demotions to lower grades. parents have been teaching the children themselves in a park fieldhouse
i don't think it's fair to demote the children in midyear,'' said dorothy lee, whose 11-year-old son, alex, was demoted from the sixth to the fifth grade. ``if she was going to demote them, i think she should have waited until the end of the year.''
principal grace dawson said she would try to make her decision stick
i took the step because my children were so far behind _ two, three, four years behind in reading _ that we had to do something,'' she said
we had to take a stand that children can't just sit in the classroom and do nothing.''
the principal said demoted students were not shifted to other classrooms but were being taught materials and subjects from the lower grades
in some cases, entire classrooms were being taught at a lower grade level, ms. dawson said
the principal appealed to the parents to come in for meetings on their children's academic problems
while some parents ran their makeshift alternative school wednesday, about 20 met with ms. dawson and another contingent attended a chicago board of education meeting to protest the demotions
but school board spokesman bob saigh said the administration supports ms. dawson. ``certainly there's support for her because it appears what she's doing is for the benefit of the students,'' he said
there were a number of comments from board members and the superintendent that the parents must work with the principal to improve achievement at beethoven,'' saigh said
most of beethoven's students live in the robert taylor homes, the nation's largest high-rise public housing project, on the city's south side
ms. dawson said the students were demoted feb. 15 because of low reading scores on the iowa basic skills test given last year and on the metropolitan achievement test given in january
it's very difficult as a professional educator to sit back and do nothing when students are so far behind,'' said the principal, assigned to beethoven in september
the school mailed demotion notices to parents feb. 9, and ms. dawson invited them to schedule individual conferences
about 25 percent of the affected parents met with her, and most then supported the demotions, she said
children whose parents still had strong objections were returned to their original class work, ms. dawson
she said the school has mailed a second notice to parents asking them to come to the school and talk
but many parents objected to having their children demoted in the middle of the school year. some predicted it would cause students to lose interest in education and drop out in later years
i will never agree to demoting my child,'' said brenda wimberly, whose 9-year-old son, dontae, was demoted from the third to the second grade. ``if his reading doesn't come up in april, then he can remain in the third grade for next year.'' police in five cities; edits to tighten. no pickup.</note>
protesters today hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police, while new president roh tae-woo promised during his inauguration to end decades of authoritarian rule and bring full democracy to the country
about 2,000 radical students and dissidents shouting ``down with roh tae-woo the murderer'' battled police in the center of seoul for a second day to protest the inauguration. police with riot shields charged the protesters
police said there were injuries on both sides, but had no figures
the general public was barred from the inauguration ceremony in front ot the national assembly building and there were no public celebrations. the invitation-only ceremony was subdued and roh received mild applause from the 25,000 guests, most of whom were officials
roh looked calm and thoughtful as he took the oath of office to become south korea's sixth president
he vowed to end human rights abuses and dictatorial rule. he promised sweeping democratic, economic and social reforms to give all koreans a voice in society
the day when freedoms and human rights could be slighted in the name of economic growth and national security has ended. the day when repressive force and torture in secret chambers were tolerated is over,'' roh said in a speech
outgoing president chun doo-hwan, disliked by many koreans for his tough authoritarian rule, listened impassively. the two men embraced at the end of the ceremony and shook hands
roh, taking office in the first peaceful transfer of power in the nation's turbulent 40-year history, said the time had come for south korea to become a full democracy
after roh was sworn in, 1,000 pigeons were released into hazy winter skies and army cannons fired a 21-gun salute, choirs sang patriotic songs and a traditional orchestra in red robes played oriental songs
thousands of riot police and plainclothes agents, anticipating violence after clashes with students in seoul and two other cities wednesday, stood guard at the inauguration and there were no incidents
but around myongdong cathedral, masked protesters pelted riot police with rocks, bricks and firebombs that exploded in orange showers of liquid flame, setting several officers ablaze
many students shouted anti-american slogans claiming the united states had rigged the election that put roh in power. ``down with the u.s.,'' protesters yelled
riot police chased bands of students who blocked main roads and tied up rush-hour traffic. clashes were also reported in the southern cities of masan, sunchon, pusan and kwangju
hundreds of protesters hurling firebombs set fire to a wooden arch set up to celebrate the inauguration in kwangju, site of a 1980 anti-government uprising that was bloodyly suppressed by the army
but onlookers ignored calls by the demonstrators to support them. police broke up the protests with a huge show of force and dozens of students were arrested
roh rode to and from the ceremony in a heavily-guarded convoy. detachments of riot police in green combat fatigues and black metal helmets stood guard in nearby sidestreets
roh appealed to opposition groups to join him in building an enduring democratic system but warned that the violent, confrontational politics of the past had to end and he would not tolerate disorder
one of the country's two main opposition parties, the party for peace and democracy, promptly rejected roh's peace offering, saying he had no right to rule and won election with massive fraud
roh won the country's first democratic presidential election in 16 years on dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote. he defeated rival opposition candidates kim young-sam and kim dae-jung, who split the opposition vote. kim young-sam later resigned as opposition leader
chun, who stepped down at the end of a seven-year term, bowed to demands for direct presidential elections after massive violent protests last june
in his inaugural speech, roh said south korea had to end the political and regional divisions that have split the nation of 41 million people. he appealed to the nation to bury past hatreds and strive for reconciliation
many koreans distrust him because he is a former general and say he lacks a mandate since he did not win an electoral majority. his decision to retain hardliners in his cabinet also has worried koreans who want reforms. york city.</note>
police today arrested a man who, upset over a bad haircut, bashed a man over the head with an ashtray, tied him up and set him and his apartment on fire, authorities said
pedro ramirez, 26, of bayshore was arrested today in suffolk county, said sgt. raymond o'donnell, a police spokesman. charges included attempted murder, arson, and robbery, o'donnell said
ramirez apparently went to the home of a friend on monday, o'donnell said
the friend, whose identity was not released, gave ramirez a haircut and ramirez then ``went nuts,'' o'donnell said
he didn't like his haircut, i guess,'' he said
ramirez then allegedly knocked the victim out with an ashtray, tied him up and set the apartment on fire
firefighters found the man tied to a chair with a blanket over his head. he was taken to new york hospital-cornell medical center with burns over 19 percent of his body
a hospital administrator said she could not give out any information about his condition. assassination.</note>
detective hans olvebro believes the identity of the gunman who killed prime minister olof palme is buried somewhere in the tons of documents or megabytes of computer data in police files
i am an optimist. we have him somewhere in our material,'' said olvebro, the third detective to lead the hunt since palme was assassinated two years ago
but despite 16,000 tips and a $8.3 million reward, police acknowledge they don't know much more about the killer or his motive than when they began
olvebro, who took over the investigation earlier this month, is leading the 35 detectives working full-time on the case. at one point there were 300
the most intensive investigation in swedish history has produced several by-products: books, plays, libel suits and, according to a police spokesman, the solution to several other crimes, including at least one unrelated murder. he refused to elaborate
palme, a four-term premier, was killed in downtown stockholm on a midnight walk home from a movie with his wife, lisbet, on feb. 28, 1986. she was grazed by a bullet
he was the first swedish leader to die violently in two centuries. the assassination rocked the self-image of a nation that treasures its soft-spoken civility and non-violent character
mourners erected a foot-high mound of flowers on the sidewalk hours after he died. it has been replenished daily, chiefly with red roses, the symbol of his social democratic party, and the spot has become a bizarre tourist attraction
the trauma of the killing is fading, judging by the organized events marking the anniversary. last year, 10,000 swedes held a torch-lit march, but this year the only planned commemoration is by a few party members holding banners in salute on the site
palme was a high-profile figure at home and abroad. he was an upper-class boy turned socialist and an international disarmament activist who was often perceived as having a pro-soviet slant
a political murder or the murder of a politician is always more difficult to solve,'' said ingvar eriksson, spokesman for the investigating team
the list of suspects ranges from right-wing extremists who objected to palme's socialism to kurdish terrorists, said to be outraged at sweden's refusal to grant refugee status to one of their leaders
the ousted president of iran, abolhassan bani-sadr, claimed the killing was ordered by the regime of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini because palme had discovered and tried to stop swedish arms smuggling to iran. bani-sadr offered no evidence to support his claim
two policemen are suing a swedish television producer for writing in a book that he saw them acting suspiciously immediately after the killing. the officers were cleared by a parliamentary commission
one man who was arrested for one week in 1986 won $30,000 in damages from a major daily after it published his name and picture. under swedish press laws, suspects cannot be identified until their conviction
the same man was detained again a few weeks ago and questioned for two days. this time, no paper published his name
olvebro's predecessor, detective superintendent inge reneborg, said when he left the investigation last month that he believed the killing was the work of an organization rather than an individual
reneborg left to go into retirement. the first chief investigator, hans holmer, was forced to step down when the case foundered after a year
official reports have charged that the police work was sloppy during the crucial first 12 hours after the killing, and that the probe was hampered by holmer's refusal to let prosecutors lead the chase
hoping to find a defector among those involved in the killing, the government raised the reward tenfold last november, advertising the prize in the international press
spokesman eriksson said one source of tips in the case has been the swedish underworld, which found the heat too intense from the search for the killer
despite frustrations, eriksson said, the search for the killer will go on, if necessary, for another 23 years until the statute of limitations takes effect
iran said its revolutionary guards destroyed 14 iraqi military bases near the northestern iraqi oil city of kirkuk, then crushed an iraqi counterattack. iraq denied there had been any fighting
iran said the guards were assisted in the military operations wednesday and today by guerrillas fighting the iraqi government and by kurdish rebels
the official islamic republic news agency said the raiders killed or wounded 500 iraqi troops in the area 50 miles southeast of kirkuk, a major oil center located 110 miles northeast of the iraqi capital of baghdad
iraq denied fighting occurred in the area. the official iraqi news agency quoted a military spokesman as saying the claim that hundreds of iraqis were killed or wounded was ``a new lie which will be added to many other lies.''
the iranian agency said the iraqi counteroffensive failed and the iraqi troops were forced to retreat. it said the guards, the iranian-backed iraqi moslem guerrillas and the kurdish rebels destroyed 14 iraqi military bases and seized several strategic heights near kirkuk
the location of the attack, and its apparently modest scale, indicated it was not the major offensive western military analysts had expected iran to launch this winter. iran and iraq have been at war for more than eight years
the analysts say iran is facing difficulties recruiting enough volunteers for the front. they say only 150,000 iranian warriors were massed on the southern border, at least 100,000 less than earlier estimates
the u.s. dollar edged higher in thin european trading today as the market waited for the release of revised u.s. economic growth figures for the fourth quarter of 1987
gold prices were slightly lower following heavy falls on wednesday
dealers said they hoped the gross national product figures, scheduled for release later today, would give some new direction to the market and lift it out of the doldrums
a good gnp figure would reduce worries about the u.s. economy, but it wouldn't change the fundamental (negative) picture,'' one dealer at a u.s. bank in frankfurt said
other dealers said they don't expect more than a short burst of activity from the gnp figures
indicators have been mostly ignored recently,'' a frankfurt dealer said. ``beside the trade figures, nothing is really important.''

undersecretary of state michael armacost today discussed with pakistan's president recent moves toward a soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan, officials said
armacost also met for nearly two hours with afghan moslem guerrilla leaders in pakistan in what a u.s. embassy official said was a ``frank and open'' exchange wednesday
he was scheduled to travel next to india for similar talks before flying back to washington
armacost's swing through the region follows secretary of state george p. shultz' trip to moscow this week, where shultz discussed the soviets' pledge to begin leaving afghanistan by may 15, depending on the outcome of the next round of u.n.-sponsored peace talks in geneva
pakistan, a participant in the geneva talks, has added a condition that a military settlement to the fighting in afghanistan be coupled with a political settlement to ensure afghan stability during a soviet troop pullout
washington has said only that a political solution would be ``desirable'' and indicated it is willing to settle for an agreement on a timetable for a soviet pullout in exchange for a halt in u.s. military aid to the guerrillas
the rebel alliance, under chairman yunis khalis, reportedly reiterated its vow to armacost that the guerrillas will continue fighting until they install themselves as an all-moslem government in kabul
one of the more extremist resistance leaders, gulbaddin hekmatyar of the hezb-i-islami party, on wednesday accused washington of betraying the guerrilla cause by striking a secret deal with moscow on ending the war
pakistani president mohammad zia ul-haq has said pakistan will not sign any accord with the present kabul government, headed by communist leader najib
pakistan, in addition to serving as headquarters for the guerrillas, also shelters about 3.5 million refugees from the 9-year-old afghan civil war
the past weeks have seen hectic diplomatic activity in all countries involved in the afghan conflict to prepare for the next, and possibly final, round of geneva talks between pakistan and afghanistan, scheduled to begin march 2
magistrates fined an unemployed hairdresser $525 for smuggling an australian rat nicknamed napoleon into england
linda squire, 21, hid the 5-week-old black and white rodent in her sweater during the 32-hour flight from perth, australia, to london
she did not declare the rat to customs officers at london's gatwick airport, and police later arrested her at her home in dawlish in southwest england, said prosecutor david bick
miss squires bought the rat in a perth pet shop for $2.60 at the end of an 11-month trip to australia
because she could not afford to put it in quarantine for the mandatory six months, the rat was cremated by a local vet
the racketeering conviction of seven members of the westies has put the murderous manhattan gang out of business, a federal prosecutor says
a federal jury convicted the seven wednesday of taking part in the westies' violent dealings, including seven murders, three attempted murders and four kidnappings
an eighth defendant was acquitted of all charges, but still faces a state murder charge in an unrelated case
in addition to racketeering, several of the seven, including westies boss james ``jimmy'' coonan, also were found guilty of various crimes ranging from attempted murder and loansharking to drug dealing and tax evasion
but the key verdict was the jury's decision that the westies did exist, that it constituted a racketeering enterprise and that the convicted defendants had participated in activities to further the gang's criminal goals
the group has been incapacitated and put out of business,'' said assistant u.s. attorney mary lee warren
during the nearly five-month trial, defense lawyers contended there was no such organization as the westies. even former gang members testifying for the prosecution conceded the name ``westies'' was created by the police and the news media to describe irish-american hoodlums on manhattan's west side
ms. warren and the other prosecutor, david brodsky, claimed the six men and two women on trial were the violent core of the westies, which seized control of a neighborhood once known as hell's kitchen on the edge of manhattan's theater district near times square
for 20 years, they claimed, the gang maintained its rule ``with horrible and ghoulish acts of murder.''
witnesses testified that in at least three murders, the victim's body was cut up and disposed of in what ms. warren called ``the nightmarish signature crime of the westies.''
most of those murders and murder plots were not separate charges in the indictment, but listed as acts in furtherance of the racketeering enterprise. to be convicted of racketeering, each defendant had to have committed at least two of the 28 racketeering acts charged
the 14-count indictment also listed 10 alleged co-racketeers who were not named as defendants because they had been slain
several witnesss also testified that the westies forged an alliance with the gambino organized crime family, said to be the largest, most powerful mafia group in the country
the verdict was reached on the eighth day of deliberations
coonan was convicted of attempted murder, murder conspiracy, loansharking, extortion and income tax evasion, among other crimes. his wife was convicted of loansharking and tax charges
the jury also found that coonan participated in most of the racketeering acts charged against him, including seven murders
a trial on any single act in this indictment would have resulted in an acquittal,'' said his lawyer, gerald shargel. ``it's just a matter of the government, piling it all together. that's the nightmare of rico (the racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act).''
in addition to coonan and his 44-year-old wife, edna, both of hazlet, n.j., the others convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy were: william ``indian'' bokun, 30; james ``jimmy mack'' mcelroy, 42; richard ``muggsy'' ritter, 50; thomas collins, 53, and his wife florence, 52, all of manhattan
only john halo, 36, of new york was acquitted on all charges. he still faces trial for the june 1985 fatal shooting of his 21-year-old nephew
u.s. district judge whitman knapp scheduled sentencing for april 18. all seven face up to 20 years apiece on both racketeering and racketeering conspiracy
villagers in northern ghana shot guns and arrows at police who came to discuss a chieftaincy dispute, leaving two officers dead and 20 wounded, ghana radio reported
the villagers in karaga fled when police sent reinforcements from nearby accra, said the report, which was monitored wednesday in abidjan
police found the bodies of police inspector p.c.k. dotsey and sgt. mandoh kokomba, who were killed saturday when a police squad arrived for talks with village elders and to arrest several villagers for recent assaults against police officers, the radio said
it quoted kwesi nkansa, the northern region police commissioner
the radio did not give details about the chieftaincy dispute, or when the reinforcements arrived to discover the bodies
nkansa told ghana radio that only one villager, a man in his 70s, was arrested and 15 others were being sought
a man who said he put a rattlesnake over the shoulder of a 21-month-old girl to show her it would not hurt her was convicted of manslaughter in the child's death from snakebite
darrell wessendorf, 24, faces a possible one- to 15-year prison sentence for the may 8, 1987, death of stevie luren kirkwood of la verkin
wessendorf had been charged with second-degree murder, which carries a possible sentence of five years to life. he had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity
wessendorf had caused a ``grave risk of death'' by bringing the snake so close to the girl and ``engaging in activities that eventually caused the reptile to bite the child,'' district judge j. phillip eves said wednesday
wessendorf, a former page, ariz., resident, said he was trying to show the girl that the snake would not hurt her when it bit her on the shoulder
he said he showed her the snake that he had found on a nearby road and partially placed it over her shoulder. the child's mother entered the room and screamed, causing wessendorf to flinch and the snake to bite the child, he said
defense attorney j. macarthur wright argued that only 0.2 percent of those bitten by rattlesnakes die and that those bitten often are not treated. he said the judge had to ``make a distinction here on what constitutes a grave risk of death.''
eves set sentencing for april 11
an 84-year-old woman was killed when a stray bullet from youths target-shooting nearby shattered her kitchen window and struck her in the chest, authorities said
neighbors expressed anger that the youths were allowed to go free after the shooting
rose cudigan died at ami valley medical center in el cajon less than two hours after being shot wednesday morning. her husband, raymond, who was standing near her in the kitchen when she was struck, was not injured and summoned help
three youths admitted they had been target shooting with a .22 caliber rifle about 100 yards away from the cudigans' home in the lakeview neighborhood of lakeside, said san diego county sheriff's sgt. danny goodrich
no charges were filed pending further investigation, and the teen-agers later were released to the custody of their parents
i'm mad and i'm bitter,'' neighbor sharon dudley said. ``we've lost a wonderful neighbor and the suspects are free.''
neighbors said youths had fired guns in the area before
the (deputies) told me they had no evidence, that i'd have to get a restraining order against those boys to stop them from firing their guns. what good is a piece of paper?'' dudley said
lt. bill baxter said the entire case may ``simply be handed to the district attorney for a review and final determination on any charges.''
under the state penal code, discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling is a felony, punishable by three, five or seven years in state prison, or by six months to a year in county jail. to 71.5.</note>
secretary of education william j. bennett said today that college entrance test scores ``are in a dead stall'' and the public is still not getting its money's worth from the schools
in saying that i am disappointed, i think i speak for the american people,'' said bennett in his annual report card on the states
bennett was delivering that verdict at a news conference where he was also releasing two wall charts nearly six feet wide crammed with statistics ranking the states on test scores, dropout rates, how much they pay teachers and other measures
it was the fifth straight year that an education secretary has released the controversial wall charts. bennett's predecessor, t.h. bell, initiated the practice
john weiss, executive director of fairtest, a cambridge, mass., group that is critical of standardized tests, said, ``it makes no sense to use a faulty thermometer to measure the nation's educational health.''
bennett said the school reform movement is alive and yielding positive results in some states, but ``there is still too much resistance to sensible and needed reform,'' including accountability measures and merit pay
this year, for the first time, the wall chart includes a list of seven states (arkansas, georgia, kentucky, new jersey, ohio, south carolina and texas) with laws allowing state officials to intervene in ``academically bankrupt'' school districts
it also lists the percentage of high scorers on the scholastic aptitude test and american college testing program, and the percentage of high school graduates who took advanced placement exams
the college entrance test scores were not new. they were made public last fall
bennett lamented that they ``are in a dead stall. the 1987 scores are basically unchanged from last year. the act average dipped by 0.1 point to 18.7, and the sat remained the same _ 906.'' the act is graded on a scale of 1-36 and the sat on a scale of 400-1,600
bennett said the graduation rate from public high schools slipped from 71.7 percent in 1985 to 71.5 percent in 1986. no figure was available for private schools
all of this is not particularly good news,'' said bennett, who recently began his fourth year as ecretary of education. but he did find some encouraging signs
last year a greater proportion of students took the act and sat tests and the advanced placement exams than ever before,'' he said. that ``means we are succeeding in keeping scores level despite a larger pool of test-takers.''
the percentage of high school graduates taking advanced placement tests has doubled since 1982, from less than 5 percent to nearly 10 percent. minority participation has grown by 78 percent since 1984, double the increase among whites
test results ``show that poor, black and hispanic children are performing better,'' said bennett, although there is still a wide gap between minority and majority scores on the college entrance tests
bennett said that since 1976 black students' scores on the sat have risen by 42 points to 728, while white students' scores fell eight points to 936
he singled out south carolina as a state that has made progress in setting high academic expectations, holding educators accountable and encouraging parental choice
although south carolina ranks last in sat scores among the 22 states where that is the dominant test, its scores have risen 17 points in two years to an average of 832. 0678</first> germany and to combine with czechoslovakian removal. edits to tighten, no pickup.</note>
soviet troops today began the early removal of nuclear missiles from east germany and czechosolovakia under terms of a new superpower arms agreement yet to be ratified
western reporters this morning saw a train loaded with 32 containers leave bischofwerda, about 20 miles east of dresden
officials at the scene said the containers were packed with parts of dismantled ss-12 rockets and that the train's destination was the soviet union, where the missiles are to be destroyed
in addition to the missile parts, 150 of 400 soviet soldiers stationed at bischofswerda also left on the train. officials at the site said the remaining soldiers will leave by the end of the month
a large banner displayed at bischofswerda's railroad station read: ``removal of shorter-range rockets, a contribution to security and peace.''
a local kindergarten class sang: ``we greet you soldiers, you protect the happiness of children.''
the top communist party functionary of bischofswerda, hannelore strugalla, said ``the first practical step in nuclear disarmament is being accomplished in our hometown.''
the ss-12s are included in the superpower treaty on removal of medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles from central europe. the accord was signed by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev in december
dmitri t. yazov, the soviet defense minister, said monday while secretary of state george p. shultz was in moscow that withdrawal of the ss-12s would begin this month as a ``display of goodwill.''
the treaty is before congress and the nominal soviet parliament for approval
there were five rocket launchers, eight missiles and four practice missiles stationed at bischofswerda, according to officials
removal of the warheads from the missiles was completed one week ago, officials said, and additional rocket parts are to be removed from the site within the next two days
soviet troops were also removing ss-12s today from waren, east germany, where there are 22 missiles, nine launchers and seven training rockets, according to figures released after the superpower treaty was signed
waren is about 90 miles northwest of berlin
the east german government arranged to transport 100 western journalists to the two sites to witness the removal of the rockets
the ss-12s _ which have a range of about 560 miles _ fall under the ``shorter-range'' classification in the superpower arms treaty, which covers rockets with a range from 300 to 3,100 miles
in czechoslovakia the loading was taking place in the moravian town of hranice, the country's official news agency ctk said
according to the report, the missiles were transported during the night from a nearby military zone to the railway station where the loading operation began
ctk added that the first of the missiles would leave hranice for the soviet union this evening
ctk quoted soviet lt. col. vyacheslav granovsky as saying soviet officers, mechanics and drivers who had serviced the missiles being dismantled would leave with the first transport today
granovsky did not say how many rockets and soviet personnel will leave czechoslovakia. he also did not say when withdrawal of all the missiles would be completed, and gave their destination only as ''a predetermined place in the soviet union.''
ctk said the removal of the soviet missiles was being watched by 60 reporters, but it was not known if any western journalists were invited
hranice, with a population of 12,500, has been singled out by czechoslovak officials as the only place in the country where soviet missiles had been stationed
the step of the soviet government, the removal of operational-tactical shorter-range missiles before ratification of the soviet-american agreement, is further proof of the sincerity, concreteness and constructive approach of the soviet peace policy to nuclear disarmament and the creation of a more secure world,'' ctk said
the withdrawal occurs during the 40th anniversary of communist rule in czechoslovakia
a polygamist charged in the bombing of a mormon chapel and a standoff with police has asked that his trial be moved out of state because of publicity and the dominance of the mormon church in utah
the polygamist, addam swapp, and co-defendants vickie singer and john timothy singer also want separate trials, court documents indicated wednesday
mrs. singer and swapp also are asking again to be released from jail. a magistrate ruled earlier that they were unlikely to voluntarily return for trial
a similar request was filed late wednesday on behalf of jonathan swapp, addam's brother, but it had not yet been added to the court file
earlier this month, mrs. singer, 44; john timothy singer, 21; addam swapp, 26, and jonathan swapp, 21, pleaded innocent to charges stemming from the jan. 16 bombing of the mormon chapel in marion and the subsequent 13-day standoff at their nearby farm
the siege ended jan. 28 with the shooting death of a corrections officer and wounding of addam swapp. state murder charges have not been filed yet
mrs. singer is the widow of john singer, a polygamist killed by police nine years ago during an arrest attempt, and the mother of john timothy singer. two of her daughters are wives of addam swapp
addam swapp's lawyers are asking u.s. district chief judge bruce s. jenkins to transfer the trial on the ground that swapp ``cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in the district of utah.''
defense attorney bill morrison said news coverage and religious prejudice make a fair trial impossible
the atmosphere is charged and volatile and rife with misinformation,'' he said. ``the lds (mormon) church represents a sizable portion of the population.''
government attorneys were not available to comment on whether they would contest any of the defense requests. up 4th graf pvs: `the civilian-backed...'</note>
president corazon aquino and thousands of filipinos joined hands today in a ``chain for peace'' to mark the second anniversary of a popular revolution that ended decades of authoritarian rule
the country's leading churchman, meanwhile, warned that the philippines cannot survive with huge gaps between rich and poor. leftists staged protest marches and accused the president of abandoning promises of reform
several hundred followers of former president ferdinand marcos rallied at a downtown manila square, calling for the ousted ruler to be allowed to return. police said the marcos loyalists dispersed peacefully after nearly three hours
about 50,000 people jammed a 1{-mile stretch of epifanio de los santos avenue, or edsa. on that same avenue in february 1986, hundreds of thousands of people formed a human wall for four days to protect mutineers holed up in two military camps from marcos' forces
the civilian-backed military mutiny, popularly called the ``people power'' revolution, forced marcos into exile in hawaii on feb. 25, 1986, after he had ruled for more than 20 years
a philippine air force t-28 airplane swooped low over the crowd, which also participated in a procession of images of the virgin mary, including one borne by an armored personnel carrier
officials said the images were the ones carried by priests and nuns during the 1986 revolt in this heavily roman catholic land
the day began with the pealing of church bells and mrs. aquino clasping hands with defense secretary fidel ramos and chief of staff gen. renato de villa on edsa, in front of the camp aguinaldo general headquarters
the ceremony was followed by a daylong carnival, featuring singing, folk dancing and performances by well-known entertainers
but during an afternoon mass, cardinal jaime l. sin, archbishop of manila, warned that the government must address the urgent social and economic crisis facing this nation. half of the 58 million filipinos live in poverty
the ever-growing gap between rich and poor in our society must be drastically reduced,'' sin said. ``only then can our nation survive and go forward.''
sin said the need for land reform ``hangs over us like a sword of damocles'' and added ``urgent reforms must be taken without delay.'' mrs. aquino ordered a land reform program last july but left details to congress, which has yet to approve the legislation
parades and festivities were held in other major cities across this nation of more than 7,100 islands
but from a shopping center near edsa, about 10,000 leftists marched to the presidential palace, waving red banners, chanting slogans and accusing mrs. aquino of betraying the reformist ideals of the uprising two years ago
on wednesday, about 20,000 leftists chanting slogans in support of communist rebels, marched to the scene of today's celebrations and burned an effigy of mrs. aquino
in 1986, sin called on filipinos to turn out into the streets to back mutineers led by then-defense minister juan ponce enrile and ramos
enrile and ramos had broken with marcos, charging him with fraud in the feb. 7, 1986, presidential election in which he ran against mrs. aquino. the rebels' action galvanized the opposition that began after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader benigno aquino, mrs. aquino's husband
prospects for broad social, economic and political reform since mrs. aquino rose to power have been clouded by a $28 billion debt, a cumbersome legislature and political polarization widened by the 19-year-old communist insurgency and the military's rising clout
as chief of staff, ramos has fended off six coup plots. but social activists fear mrs. aquino's reliance on ramos has lessened the government's commitment to reform
the government so far has not prosecuted soldiers for alleged involvement in several widely publicized killings of civilians. nor has it fulfilled mrs. aquino's 1986 campaign promise to abolish the civilian home defense force, a military-backed militia widely accused of human rights abuses
gunmen today hurled a hand grenade at shiite moslem militiamen searching for a kidnapped u.s. marine in south lebanon. police said eight people were wounded
a police spokesman said two gunmen threw the grenade from a speeding car at an amal militia checkpoint near the inland village of dweir. militiamen at the checkpoint were searching cars looking for lt. col. william r. higgins
the attack coincided with a threat by amal to use force to free higgins. amal also summoned shiite clerics to a meeting to discuss his abduction
six amal militiamen were wounded along with two civilians,'' said the police spokesman. he cannot be named in line with standing regulations
higgins, 43, was abducted feb. 17 near tyre, 50 miles south of beirut. he headed an observer group assigned to a united nations peacekeeping force in south lebanon
the pro-iranian organization of the oppressed on earth claimed it abducted higgins and alleged he was a cia spy. u.s. and u.n. officials denied the accusation
higgins is one of nine americans and 25 foreigners missing in lebanon
the shiite militiamen, the police spokesman said, opened fire at the speeding car, but the two gunmen escaped. he did not elaborate
amal, in a statement, identified the attackers only as ``suspicious elements.'' it confirmed that six of its militiamen were wounded in the blast
dweir, a stronghold of the iranian-backed hezbollah, is 15 miles northeast of the port of tyre
the resort to force to free higgins is not unlikely once we locate the place where he is being held,'' said daoud daoud, amal's military commander in south lebanon
daoud, who has been supervising the search for higgins, said he had ``confirmed information that 25 people specializing in kidnapping have been sent to south lebanon to abduct more foreigners.'' he did not elaborate
daoud's remarks were broadcast by the beirut-based voice of the nation radio. it was not the first statement by amal that it would use strong measures to free higgins, but it was the most clear-cut reference so far to using force
a spokesman for the syrian-backed amal said improved weather conditions ``allowed us to speed up the search'' for higgins southeast of tyre
we believe higgins is still in the area south of the litani river,'' he said. he refused to elaborate on the remark. the litani river is four miles north of tyre
the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said every car leaving the area south of the river was being searched
amal, he said, also summoned shiite clerics in south lebanon to a meeting in tyre to discuss higgins' abduction and its effect on the shiite community
amal has arrested six men it says were involved in the kidnapping. the detainees, however, have not been able to provide information on the whereabouts of higgins and the mastermind of the abduction, who reportedly has fled the area
the detainees, according to the spokesman, include the three gunmen who seized higgins and the three who monitored his movements before the abduction
amal also has arrested the man who was supposed to take higgins to beirut, the spokesman said
the seven detainees are among 42 members of the iranian-backed hezbollah captured by amal in the tyre region in connection with the abduction of higgins
the organization of the oppressed on earth is a pro-iranian underground faction believed linked with hezbollah. hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for underground factions involved in the kidnapping of the 25 foreigners in lebanon
the longest held foreign hostage is terry a. anderson, 40, chief middle east correspondent for the associated press. he was seized in moslem west beirut march 16, 1985
a former argentine general accused of kidnapping and killing civilians in his country was told his refusal to answer lawyers' questions would harm him in a u.s. civil suit by a former prisoner
u.s. district judge samuel conti told carlos suarez mason on wednesday that if he continued his silence, any fact he was asked about would be considered true for the purposes of the $20 million lawsuit
suarez mason, who is fighting extradition to argentina, defied an order by a federal magistrate earlier this week and refused to answer questions about his alleged responsibility for atrocities in military prisons during the late 1970s
the proposed questions include whether suarez mason had authority to order torture and executions at prisons run by the first army corps, which he commanded from 1976 to 1979
the former general said monday he would not answer questions without having a lawyer. the issue of whether the lawyer suarez mason has hired for the extradition case must also represent him in three civil suits without additional pay is now before the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals
conti told the lawyers to submit written questions and ordered suarez mason to be ready to answer on march 28, a day before the scheduled trial of the civil suit and a week after his scheduled extradition hearing before another judge
suarez mason, 63, is charged in argentina with 43 murders and 24 kidnappings of civilians, allegedly committed by soldiers under his command during the so-called ``dirty war'' against suspected leftists
he fled argentina after a civilian government came to power in 1983 and was arrested in january 1987 at his home in foster city, south of san francisco. he is being held without bail
three civil suits have been filed against him by former argentinians now living in the united states, who say they were tortured or their relatives were killed by soldiers under the general's command. u.s. courts have allowed damage suits for acts committed abroad in violation of international law by a foreigner who is physicially in the court's district
a witness said at the kidnapping trial of abbas hamadi that a lebanese mediator may have been involved in the 1987 abduction of two west germans whom he was reputedly working to free
ronnie andrea klein told the court wednesday that she once lived with the mediator, businessman rashid mahroum, and had last talked with him in november 1987
i had a feeling that he (mahroum) might be involved with the kidnappings,'' she said
mahroum, who now lives in lebanon, has denied any involvement in the january 1987 kidnapping of west germans rudolf cordes and alfred schmidt in beirut
hamadi is on trial in duesseldorf on charges of masterminding the abductions in a bid to win the release of his brother, mohammed hamadi, who is charged in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a twa airliner
the west german government last year arranged for mahroum to act as a middleman with the captors of cordes and schmidt
federal police have said they are now seeking mahroum for questioning in the kidnappings
ms. klein told the court she lived with mahroum in the west german city of fuerth from april 1984 to december 1985, and that the two were still on friendly terms up to late last year
i last spoke to him on the telephone in november,'' ms. klein said, adding she believed he was then in beirut
mahroum traveled to beirut as a mediator in february 1987, returning with a photocopy of cordes' passport and demands by his captors that west germany reject a u.s. extradition request for mohammed hamadi
are you aware if he (mahroum) has any special political or religious convictions?'' chief judge klaus arend asked ms. klein
none that i know of,'' she testified
west german security officials say they believe cordes is being held by hezbollah, or party of god, a radical shiite moslem group with close ties to iran
mohammed hamadi is being held in a frankfurt prison, awaiting trial on charges of air piracy and murder in connection with the june 1985 hijacking. no date has been set for the trial
thirty-nine americans were held hostage for 17 days and a u.s. navy diver was killed during the twa hijacking
west germany last year turned down the u.s. extradition request, saying it would try mohammed hamadi instead
in earlier trial testimony, chancellor helmut kohl's chief of staff, wolfgang schaeuble, said the government was forced into making that decision, fearing for the lives of cordes and schmidt
schmidt and cordes were kidnapped in beirut shortly after the jan. 13, 1987 arrest in frankfurt of mohammed hamadi. cordes remains a hostage in lebanon, but schmidt was released in september
another west german, ralph rudolph shray, was kidnapped on jan. 27 and remains a hostage. there have been no claims for that abduction
abbas hamadi's trial resumes march 1, with further testimony expected about mahroum
the census bureau called today for local govrnment help updating the accuracy of maps to be used in the 1990 national head count
each of the approximately 39,000 municipal and county governments across the nation will be sent a computer-drawn map next month, showing the most current boundaries on file at the bureau
census officials are asking that local government leaders review these maps and make any changes necessary
even if local boundaries have not changed, local leaders were urged to carefully inspect the maps, which are the first prepared by the bureau's new computerized mapping system, said robert w. marx of the census geography office. he said the agency wants to promptly catch any errors that may have occurred in preparing the maps
the bureau estimates that one municipality in five has had some boundary change since the 1980 census through annexations, detachments, incorporation or disincorporation. of snow, negotiators adjourning after marathon session, new comments from federal mediator, transition. pickup 11th graf, `union negotiators...</note>
a strike by public school teachers set for today was put on hold this morning as union negotiators considered the district's latest contract offer and school officials canceled classes because of snow
talks recessed at 6:30 a.m. today when negotiators for the cleveland teachers union agreed to take the school board's latest proposal to the union's executive board later in the day
superintendent alfred tutela called off classes for the district's 72,639 students, citing the weather, although no other area school districts were closed. cleveland received up to 3 inches of snow overnight
the district is ohio's largest public school system
union negotiators had set a bargaining deadline of 3 p.m. wednesday and a strike deadline of midnight, but talks continued into early this morning at a downtown hotel under the supervision of federal mediator jack buettner
union president eugene kolach said teachers would not set up picket lines outside schools because classes had been canceled. he declined further comment
the union's executive board agreed to meet at 3 p.m. today to consider the board's proposal, buettner said. he declined to say whether he believed the proposal could lead to a tentative contract
both sides were probably shooting for higher goals than they were able to obtain,'' buettner said. ``there are several stumbling blocks, and i can't really get into a lot of detail.''
the union, which has 5,093 members, has been without a contract since sept. 1
the school system had planned to close schools if a strike materialized, but continue classes for the district's 3,600 high school seniors
bargainers would not comment on details of the negotiations, but both sides have differed on the issues of teacher salaries and a career ladder system
the latest bargaining session began at 10 a.m. tuesday and continued almost non-stop until 6:30 a.m. today, except for a three-hour break wednesday night. buettner shuttled offers back and forth between the bargaining committees, which were in separate rooms at downtown hotel
tutela last month urged teachers to accept a mandatory career ladder system that would hinge pay raises to performance evaluations
union negotiators have said they want participation in the career ladder to be an option
the union had been seeking a 5.8 percent wage increase this year, while the district was offering a 2 percent one-time bonus payment. union negotiators said the amount of the increases could vary depending on the length of the proposed contract
annual salaries for teachers range from $17,687 for beginners to $37,457 for teachers with a master's degree and 35 years experience. the average teacher pay is $29,000

a u.s. supreme court ruling overturning a $200,000 award won by the rev. jerry falwell against hustler magazine has dashed a legal argument that could have stifled political satire, constitutional lawyers say
the unanimous decision wednesday held that even pornographic parodies about public figures are protected by the first amendment as long as the satire could not be reasonably interpreted as factual
the decision was greeted with relief by first amendment specialists
i've been telling my class, if that one makes it, we're in trouble, the first amendment is in serious difficulty,'' said professor c. thomas dienes of the george washington university national law center
falwell had successfully argued in lower courts that he had suffered emotional distress as a result of an ad parody in hustler's november 1983 and march 1984 issues. the ``advertisement'' had a photograph of falwell and purportedly quoted him discussing a sexual encounter with his mother and describing himself as a habitual drunkard. at the bottom in small print, readers were told that the ad was ``not to be taken seriously.''
the jury in the original falwell suit found that there was no libel, but awarded falwell $200,000 after finding the magazine parody had intentionally caused him emotional distress
falwell stood by his arguments wednesday
i fully appreciate the deep concerns the court has shown for the sacredness of the first amendement,'' falwell said in a statement. ``however, i respectfully disagree with their ruling. just as no person may scream ``fire!'' in a crowded theater when there is no fire, and find cover under the first amendment, likewise, no sleaze-merchant like (hustler publisher) larry flynt should be able to use the first amendment as an excuse for maliciously and dishonestly attacking public figures as he has so often done
i believe the supreme court has given the green light to larry flynt and his ilk to print what they wish about any public figure at any time with no fear of reprisal.''
but first amendment lawyers said falwell's claim of distress as the basis for a libel judgment invited such chaos in the libel field that even such supreme court justices as william rehnquist and antonin scalia, not considered steadfast supporters of press rights, could not accept it
the high court also rejected falwell's claim that the parody was libelous because of its ``outrageousness.''
the concept of outrageousness is so ambiguous that it is just not viable as a basis for first amendment standards,'' said dienes. ``if they allowed that, it would have opened an incredible amount of litigation against the media. just imagine the number of parodies that cause humiliation, embarrassment.''
don gillmor, director of the university of minnesota's silha center for the study of media ethics and law, said the language in falwell's argument actually dates back to an 1897 case in england, wilkinson vs. downston, which held that a statement could be libelous if it was ``extreme and outrageous exceeding all reasonable bounds of decency, leading to emotional distress that is severe and is intentionally reckless.''
gillmor said the high court apparently rejected that theory because it ``opened up indefinition, confusion and even judicial chaos, and (the supreme court) just didn't want to deal with it. even if they didn't like the press protections, this doctrine was just too complex an alternative.''
i think rough-and-tumble should be the rule,'' said a.e. dick howard, a university of virginia law professor. ``i think the opinion is right on.''
iran said today that saudi arabia has forbidden a representative of iranian revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini from visiting the country to prepare for the moslem pilgrimage
the official islamic republic news agency quoted prime minister hussein musavi as saying this was evidence of the insolence of the saudi government. the agency did not provide a direct quote
it said the saudis refused to let emam jamarani, khomeini's representative and head of the pilgrimage and religious endowments organization, travel to saudi arabia in preparation of the july gathering
last summer, riots in the holy city of mecca during the pilgrimage left 402 people dead, more than half of them iranians. tehran said police sprayed pilgrims with machine-gun fire. riyadh said the violence was planned by iran and many of the victims died in stampedes
there was no immediate saudi response to musavi's comments
saudi arabian interior minister prince nayef has affirmed that the kingdom will not tolerate a recurrence of last year's ``sacrilegious acts.''
any acts against the safety and security of the pilgrims and the holy sites will be sternly dealt with,'' he said
iran has said it plans to send 150,000 pilgrims this year and will organize ``antipathy towards pagans'' rallies again, similar to the event last year that ended in death
moslems are required to undertake the pilgrimage at least once in their life if they can afford it
robert bork said today the defeat of his supreme court nomination has discouraged lawyers from publishing controversial legal articles and advised future nominees to consider waging a national campaign to get on the court
i think this has been very bad for the intellectual life of the law,'' said bork, who resigned as a federal appeals court judge three weeks ago
his experience has led several lawyers to withdraw articles from legal publications, bork said in an interview on abc's ``good morning america.'' he described the new lawyers' credo as: ``express only noble sentiments and arrive at only noncontroversial results.''
bork said judges who have written less than he has could simply refuse to answer questions about their judicial philosophy at confirmation hearings, but he felt it necessary to discuss issues about which he had written
it certainly will inhibit the development of their thought, and it will certainly inhibit the development of the law's evolving intellectual structure,'' he said
bork said that as a judge he did not think it proper for him to wage a media campaign for his appointment, but said of future nominees: ``i would advise them to think about it because i think the alternative is defeat if this kind of campaign is waged against them.''
bork said he wished the white house had done more to counter the media and mail campaign against his nomination, which was rejected by the senate
the white house was caught flat-foooted by an unexpectedly virilent campaign and just didn't get around to responding in time. i understand that,'' said bork, who is joining the institute for public policy research, an educational and research organization that says it takes no positions on public policy issues. soldiers</head>
police today sealed off a busy street in belfast's main shopping area after a bomb planted by the irish republican army killed two british soldiers and injured two others and a civilian
while police investigated the explosion, a soldier charged in the shooting death of a roman catholic civilian was freed on bail and then turned over to military custody
the ira, which is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland, claimed responsibility for the wednesday night bombing in a telephoned statement to belfast news organizations
police said pvt. james cummings and pvt. frederick starrett, both 22, were killed by the remote-controlled explosive as they locked the steel anti-terrorist gates on royal avenue in downtown belfast. two soldiers and a 57-year-old civilian bystander were slightly injured
belfast police said the bomb probably contained about 150 pounds of explosives. the blast shattered the windows of shops and offices several hundred yards away
northern ireland secretary tom king called the attack ``a carefully planned and very vicious one indeed.''
the anti-terrorist gates are guarded by ulster defense regiment soldiers, who search the bags and other items of shoppers and others passing in and out during the day
police said the bomb went off at 11 p.m. when few civilians were about and that there was no warning from the bombers
the two deaths brought northern ireland's death toll since sectarian and political violence flared in 1969 to at least 2,628
on wednesday, police charged an 18-year-old british soldier, pvt. david jonathan holden, with unlawfully killing an unarmed catholic civilian last sunday. a northern ireland court today turned holden over to military custody on $1,925 bail
the defense said holden will plead innocent to the charge of unlawfully killing aidan mcanespie, 23, from an army observation post at a checkpoint near auchnacloy, half a mile from the irish republic's border. holden's court appearance is set for march 9
mcanespie was an election worker for sinn fein, the legal political arm of the ira. the british army said mcanespie was killed by a ricocheting bullet after a machine gun was fired accidentally
but cardinal tomas o fiaich, roman catholic primate of all ireland, has said he believes mcanespie was murdered. catholic leaders in the province said mcanespie had been regularly harassed by the army
an off-duty police officer shot a man to death early today during an armed robbery attempt in a restaurant after the man reached for a weapon and challenged the officer to shoot him, police say
the shooting was the fifth involving dallas police in less than two months. six people have died, including two officers
shoot me,'' dallas police lt. ron waldrop quoted the man as telling the off-duty officer as he reached for the weapon in his waistband. the officer was not in uniform
the man was shot twice and was pronounced dead at the scene, waldrop said
police withheld the names of the officer and the victim
we are still doing the interviews,'' detective rick silva said. ``more details will be available later.''
the off-duty officer entered a denny's restaurant in southwest dallas to purchase food when he saw that a man had confronted a waitress near a cash register, waldrop said
the officer said he heard the man demand money and saw what appeared to be a pistol in the man's waistband, waldrop said. investigators later discovered that the weapon was actually a knife with a handle similar to a pistol's, waldrop said
the officer displayed his badge and gun and identified himself, waldrop said. it was then that the man went for the weapon and challenged the officer to shoot him
dallas police have come under fire by minority leaders and city hall in the past two years for being trigger-happy when confronting suspects, especially blacks and hispanics
however, tension flared last month after police chief billy prince accused council members of fostering anti-police sentiment that led to the death of officer john chase in a highly publicized shooting jan. 23
witnesses told police that chase was shot by a transient who had wrestled his gun from him and was egged on by some spectators. the transient was later shot to death after firing at police
since then, many rallies have been staged in support of the department. 02-25 0486</first>
president reagan's assertion that secretary of state george p. shultz and former defense secretary caspar w. weinberger did not object to the idea of an arms-for-hostages deal with iran goes against earlier statements by himself and the two cabinet officers
the president, responding to a question about whether vice president george bush objected to the failed policy, said at his news conference wednesday night that he did not ``want to be surrounded by yes men. and yes, there were reservations.''
the president, as in the past, declined to elaborate on bush's role. he then pointed to shultz and weinberger as others who voiced objections _ but he said they were not opposed to the basic policy
they did not object to the idea that we were trading arms for hostages,'' the president said
he said that shultz and weinberger ``knew what we were trying to do'' and implied their main concern was public image
their objection was that, if and when this became known, as it would be, it would appear that we were trading hostages for, or arms for hostages,'' he said
a year ago, after the two cabinet secretaries complained about the tower commission report statement that they didn't fight the policy hard enough, reagan backed their position
both secretary shultz and secretary weinberger advised me strongly not to pursue the initiative,'' he said. ``i weighed their advice and decided in the end that the initiative was worth the risk and went forward.''
shultz, asked about the comments today during a flight to israel, said he had testified ``endlessly'' and that it was based largely on his own records
i am not going to go over it anymore,'' he said. ``i've testified and i really don't have anything to add or subtract because my testimony is based to a very healthy extent on records and notes and so on.''
shultz and weinberger, testifying last summer before congressional investigators, said they were kept in the dark by the white house aides arranging the deals
shultz said he was ``sick to my stomach'' when he first learned some of the details of the policy. he said he fought a ``battle royal'' to make sure reagan was aware of what was going on
both shultz and weinberger said they objected to the plans in 1985 and at a dec. 7 meeting that year ``i made a very strong objection to the whole idea, as did the secretary of state,'' weinberger said
weinberger said he objected because the united states was asking other countries not to sell arms to iran, that there was no one reliable to deal with there, and that if it were an arms-for-hostages deal the government was laying itself open to blackmail. three</head> weight of coins broke through roof of armored truck, other details. no pickup. corrects style of brink's, sted brinks, in 7th graf, bgng `the guard...'; adds byline.</note>
an armored truck hauling $400,000 in coins overturned on a freeway, spilling a torrent of change that broke through the truck's roof and scattered across the lanes, authorities said today
three people were treated for minor injuries
the weight of the coins actually blew the top of the vehicle right out,'' said california highway patrol officer lyle whitten, describing the accident late wednesday on the eastbound pomona freeway
a guard riding in the back of the truck was ejected by the force, but he escaped serious injury
he wasn't buried (in coins), and that's what saved him,'' whitten said
the guard and two other people in the truck were treated and released at queen of the valley hospital for minor injuries, said nursing supervisor terri coleman. their names were not released
i understand they're all ok,'' said bill beamon of brink's inc. in san bernardino
the three-ton armored truck was hauling $400,000 in coins from los angeles to san bernardino-area banks when both right rear dual tires blew out, whitten said
the truck careened out of control and rolled onto its side as boxes of coins knocked the roof off and scattered onto the freeway lanes
brink's and highway patrol officials said they couldn't estimate the weight of the coins, but nelson italiano at the union plaza casino in las vegas said an average weight of the various coins could equal 38 tons
it's approximately a half-million dollars in the no. 4 (lane), the on ramp and the right shoulder,'' said officer richard perez of the highway patrol
most of the money was boxed, whitten said, but about $300 in loose half dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies rolled across some 35 feet of roadway
sgt. john williams, an off-duty highway patrol motorcycle officer, on his way home from work, saw the accident and stopped to secure the area, whitten said
people had already started to stop, even before he got off his motorcycle ... and he shooed them away.''
another brink's truck carrying paper money stopped to help the victims, whitten said
the highway patrol shut down several freeway lanes as brink's employees gathered the boxed and loose change and loaded it into another armored vehicle, dispatcher sabrina elswick said. most of the money was recovered, officials said

pentecostal leaders gathered today to deliberate the fate of tv evangelist jimmy swaggart after an admitted prostitute said she performed pornographic acts for him for about a year
the woman's account, in a new orleans television interview wednesday, added to pressures besetting the executive presbytery of the assemblies of god, at its international headquarters here
the nation's largest pentecostal denomination, which gets $12 million a year from jimmy swaggart world ministries in baton rouge, la., reported being swamped with up to 300 calls an hour since the evangelist confessed last sunday to unspecified sexual misconduct
about half of the callers complained that the denomination's louisiana council's recommendation that swaggart be suspended from preaching for three months and receive counseling was too lenient, said juleen turnage, assemblies' secretary of information
a lot of people are unhappy with the initial recommendation,'' said the rev. richard champion, editor of the denomination's weekly, pentecostal evangel. ``many thought it too light. some thought it too severe.''
mrs. turnage said public sentiment would not be a factor for 12 presbyters who planned to convene this afternoon in a closed session to discuss swaggart's punishment
the church's final verdict will be in accord with ``the seriousness of the offense,'' mrs. turnage said
an unwritten church precedent is that those involved in sexual offenses are barred from preaching for at least a year. ``it's never been less than a year,'' she said
church sources raised the possibility that the presbytery could instruct the louisiana district council to reconsider its recommendations on grounds that members of swaggart's board improperly participated and the results were announced prematurely
it created tremendous pressures, appearing that the louisiana district was trying to dictate its judgment,'' said the rev. howard cummings of aurora, colo., a former district presbyter
swaggart, whose ministry brought in $142 million in 1986, is the denomination's most prominent evangelist with fire-and-brimstone broadcasts in more than 100 countries. he has been known for his harsh denunciations of sexual lapses by other preachers, including ptl founder jim bakker
evangelist marvin gorman has a $90 million lawsuit pending against swaggart, claiming swaggart falsely accused him of numerous acts of adultery. gorman reportedly gave the denomination photographs of swaggart entering and leaving a motel room with a prostitute
a woman who gave her name as debra murphree told wvue-tv of new orleans that she had met with swaggart for about a year at various motels to perform pornographic acts
to me, i think he's kind of perverted or, you know, talking about some of the things that we talked about in the rooms, you know, i wouldn't want him around my children,'' murphree told a reporter who traced her to a motel in west palm beach, fla., on wednesday
the station did not say how the reporter tracked the woman down, but said it did not pay for the interview
the station quoted her as saying she was the woman with swaggart when he was photographed last october, and that she did not have sexual intercourse with swaggart
he wanted me to get naked and maybe lay on the bed and pose for him,'' she said
he asked me if he could take me home and get dressed up in a dress or something, you know, no underwear and ride around you know and just, maybe in the evening, and take my clothes off and maybe get out of the car and just get back in and, you know, it sort of turned him on.''
the jefferson parish sheriff, in new orleans' western suburbs, said wednesday that murphree had been arrested for soliciting for prostitution. police in tampa, fla., similarly reported that murphree had been arrested in 1985 and 1986 for loitering for prostitution and soliciting for exposure
tampa police said murphree also was known to them as deborah arlene hedge, 28, a native of princeton, ind
murphree said her trysts with swaggart occurred in motels on airline highway between new orleans and baton rouge. she said swaggart would pick her up once or twice a month in his telephone-equipped lincoln town car
she said swaggart never discussed god or religion with her
the washington post reported today that witnesses said swaggart wore hats, sunglasses and headbands, or combed his hair down in front to help disguise himself
murphree said she was sure her companion was swaggart even though he did not use his name:
oh, i knew who he was.''
a new drug for treating endometriosis may provide an alternative for women unable to tolerate the side effects of the only medicine now available for this common condition, doctors say
a report published today concludes that the drug, called nafarelin, works as well as danazol, the standard medical treatment
about 5 percent of all women during their reproductive years have endometriosis. the disorder occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus grows in other places in the female reproductive system. symptoms can include back and abdominal pain during or after menstrual periods. severe cases may require drug treatment or surgery
although danazol is highly effective, some women cannot take it because of its side effects. nafarelin also causes some unwanted symptoms, but experts say these may be less offensive to some patients
a report on a comparison of the two drugs in 213 women was published in the new england journal of medicine. the test was directed by dr. milan r. henzi of syntex research, a pharmaceutical firm in palo alto, calif
in my opinion, this is the best-designed and best-executed trial of drug therapy for endometriosis ever reported,'' dr. robert l. barbieri of harvard medical school wrote in an accompanying editorial
danazol is derived from the male sex hormone testosterone. some women who take it complain of weight gain, swelling, acne, hair growth and deepening of the voice, among other side effects. danazol also causes unfavorable changes in blood cholesterol levels
nafarelin, which is given as a nasal spray, does not affect cholesterol levels, but it has other side effects, mainly hot flashes, descreased sex drive and vaginal dryness
in the study, both drugs reduced the extent of the disease in more than 80 percent of patients
barbieri said that for women who cannot tolerate danazol, nafarelin ``represents an important therapeutic alternative.''
the new drug is one of a class of synthetic hormones that temporarily shut off the body's production of sex hormones. nafarelin is also being tested as a treatment for prostate enlargement in men. currently, the drug is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration only for treatment of prostate cancer. protest services; predictions of violence and additional comments from critics. no pickup.</note>
two south african church leaders, including anglican archbishop desmond tutu, today called for nationwide services to protest the government crackdown on 18 opposition groups
i hope our people will still be willing to try non-violent strategies. ... but we have nothing to show for our non-violent approaches. if violence erupts, what will be surprising is that it has taken so long,'' said tutu, who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his fight against apartheid
tutu met with the rev. frank chikane, general-secretary of the south african council of churches, to discuss a response to the orders banning political activities by the opposition organizations
i would not be surprised if they (the government) act against the church,'' chikane told reporters
the meeting took place at khotso house, the johannesburg headquarters for many of the restricted organizations. black paper was draped at khotso house as a sign of mourning
both clergymen appealed to the black majority not to lose hope, to white voters to disassociate themselves from the government, and to the international community to isolate south africa
newspapers, business leaders and politicans criticized the government, saying the suppression of the major black political groups would provoke violence
in lusaka, zambia, the outlawed african national congress called for ``resistance and defiance.'' the anc is the main guerrilla organization fighting to end white-minority domination in south africa
the organizations and civic bodies that have thus been banned were committed to non-violent forms of struggle,'' the anc said in a statement
it is not advocacy of or engagement in armed struggle that the regime fears, but the very expression of democratic opposition.''
president p.w. botha on wednesday gave law and order minister adriaan vlok the power to prohibit all activity by any organization. vlok immediately banned 17 organizations, including the largest anti-apartheid coalition, the united democratic front, from engaging in political activities
he also prohibited the nation's largest labor federation, the 750,000-member congress of south african trade unions, from engaging in any political activity, including commemorating days of importance to blacks
in addition, restrictions were imposed on the activities of individual black leaders
i regret the further erosion of the rule of law. ... banning and detentions can never be the solution,'' said the rev. allan hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race house of parliament. whites and people of mixed race are represented in parliament, but not the 26 million black majority
colin eglin, leader of the anti-apartheid progressive federal party, said, ``the government was busy turning south africa into a third-grade banana republic where real power is not with the parliament, the courts or the people but in the hands of a restricted political clique.''
gavin relly, chairman of anglo-american corp., the nation's biggest conglomerate, said, ``the curtailment of civil and political freedoms to the interests of public order should be subject to judicial control. yesterday's actions are steps away from the rule of law.''
the new nation, a newspaper for blacks published by the south african catholic bishops conference, was among several observers predicting increased violence because of the regulations, which vlok said were meant to improve the atmosphere of peace and security
trade unionists have warned that by banning the commemoration of days of mourning, the government has set the stage for massive confrontation,'' the new nation said. ``the ban is unlikely to stop workers from observing these days.''
the citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said the government actions were inevitable but added: ``suppression of radical or revolutionary movements does not solve the country's problems. it only provides the space within which solutions can be found.''
the orders ``violate a number of basic freedoms, more particularly the freedoms of association and expression,'' said robert charlton, vice chancellor of the university of the witwatersrand. he said the clampdown would provoke protest and disruption on campuses
the large black political organization inkatha was not among those restricted. but the leadership in the kwazulu legislative assembly, headed by inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi, condemned the restriction of black organizations, including those with which inkatha has been feuding
there would be no need for the state of emergency if black democracy was unshackled and if blacks were free to support the leaders and the parties of their choice,'' the kwazulu caucus said. soviet union</head> dishonorable discharge. pickup 3rd graf, `the sentence...</note>
a military judge today convicted an army private who fled his west german post for the soviet union on a charge of being absent without leave, rejecting the more serious charge of desertion
pfc. wade e. roberts received a bad conduct discharge and was stripped of his military benefits, but avoided imprisonment. he could have faced one year of hard labor on the awol conviction
the sentence, imposed by col. earl pauley, brought moans and gasps from those in the courtroom
the military's lawyer, capt. daniel shaver, who prosecuted the case, said afterward he was shocked by the sentence and had expected roberts to serve prison time
roberts and his wife hugged and kissed after the verdict was announced
roberts fled his base at giessen, west germany, on feb. 28 and traveled with his girlfriend, petra neumann, to the soviet union. he returned to west germany on nov. 4, and was arrested the following day
the military had pressed for the desertion charge in the two-day court-martial at fort dix
roberts' attorney, ronald kuby, said pauley's decision showed ``we're not going to have a political trial, we're not going to have a show trial. we're not going to punish people because they make friends in the soviet union.''
roberts testified earlier today that he returned to the west from his eight-month self-imposed exile to the soviet union because he and his pregnant girlfriend became disenchanted with communism and feared being trapped there
i wanted to get out of the country,'' roberts said. ``we didn't like it.''
the riverside, calif., serviceman calmly told the court that he and his girlfriend, whom he later wed, didn't like their work at a soviet snake laboratory. he also said that he feared that if his son was born there, he would automatically be granted soviet citizenship
we felt if he were a soviet citizen, we'd be trapped there, and we wouldn't be able to leave,'' roberts said
on wednesday roberts testified he was told to stop seeing ms. neumann
i was told by my first sergeant i shouldn't see my wife anymore _ at the time, she wasn't my wife _ she was pregnant,'' roberts said. ``i was put on restriction, and i was experiencing some problems with my sergeants
i left, and i went to petra's apartment,'' he added. ``i stayed away for over 30 days, and eventually i ended up in the soviet union.''
kuby, said roberts' actions didn't meet the legal definition of desertion: unauthorized absence with no intent to return to the military
wade roberts panicked,'' kuby said. ``he didn't want to be separated from his wife.''
shaver called more than a half-dozen witnesses to the stand to establish that roberts didn't like his unit, had disciplinary problems and wanted to leave
one witness, alfred santos, a security officer at the u.s. embassy in bonn, said he spoke by telephone to roberts the day of his arrest. santos said roberts pleaded to be allowed to turn himself in to embassy officials
he said ... words to the effect he didn't trust the military ... and that he didn't want to go back,'' said santos
kuby argued that roberts maintained his u.s. citizenship while in the soviet union and kept his military identification card
roberts' attorneys argued he was the target of ``selective and vindictive prosecution,'' and that he was being tried because he fled to a communist country. they asked that the charge be dismissed
kuby said that of the 1,048 awol or desertion cases processed last year at fort dix, fewer than 10 resulted in prosecutions
but shaver contended the army has prosecuted cases like roberts'. he said roberts' choice of the soviet union is a legitimate factor in determining whether to proceed with desertion charges
pauley agreed, and said the defense did not prove their client had been singled out
the case is being heard by a judge because roberts exercised his option not to be tried by a jury of five officers and enlisted personnel
ms. neumann attended the court martial, but refused to answer most questions from reporters. the couple have a 2-month-old son
president saddam hussein pardoned a british businessman sentenced to life in prison for bribing iraqi officials after a plea from british prime minister margaret thatcher, officials said today
a british embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the iraqi president pardoned john smith on wednesday as david mellor, a british foreign office minister, held talks with iraqi officials
in london, the foreign office said mellor delivered a letter to the iraqi president from mrs. thatcher asking for his help in obtaining smith's release
it said 46-year-old smith of hazelmere in lancashire had not been released yet. ``we don't expect it to be too long. there are bureaucratic procedures to complete,'' said a spokesman
the foreign office said smith's release ``is the happy culmination of a number of efforts over a number of years.'' it added that ``no deals have been struck.''
the iraqi officials accused of being involved with smith were tried and executed
smith, managing director of the specialist vehicle manufacturer hestair dennis, was arrested in 1979 while talking with an iraqi official in a park
he was convicted in 1980 of bribing officials and sentenced to life imprisonment, which in iraq means 20 years
at the time he was also accused of ``economic espionage'' but it was not clear whether he was ever formally charged or convicted on such a charge
the iraqis convicted in the case were executed according to an iraqi law that prohibits receiving bribes from foreign salesman or providing them with information related to the state
another british businessman, ian rechter, is imprisoned in iraq after being tried in 1987 and convicted of bribing the mayor of baghdad, who was found guilty of taking bribes from rechter and later executed
mellor also pressed for rechter's release but no decision has yet been taken by iraqi authorities. quote. pick up 9th graf pvs: `one unidentified...'</note>
a bomb exploded near a crowded grandstand tonight as thousands of filipinos marked the second anniversary of the overthrow of president ferdinand marcos, police said
elisa florido, a nurse at the medical city hospital, said 14 people were injured, mostly by flying glass and debris. none was seriously hurt, she said, and there were no reports of fatalities
the blast occurred at about 10 p.m. near the main grandstand set up on epifanio de los santos avenue, or edsa, a broad boulevard between two military camps
it was at edsa two years ago that hundreds of thousands of filipinos came to protect mutinous troops from soldiers loyal to marcos. the four-day standoff culminated in his flight to exile in hawaii on feb. 25, 1986
the blast occurred about five hours after president corazon aquino, manila archbishop cardinal jaime l. sin and other dignitaries attended a mass at the grandstand and prayed for peace in this troubled island nation
none of the dignitaries were believed to be at the scene during the blast
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing
the military had been on full alert in case communist rebels or right-wing dissidents tried to disrupt the celebrations
one witness, monica soliman, told radio station dzxl that she and her family were returning to their car when they saw two men behind the stage tying what appeared to be three sticks
when we reached the car, we turned on the radio and suddenly we heard an explosion,'' she said
one unidentified man, interviewed by radio station dzxl, said the blast occurred during a fireworks display
we were watching the fireworks when suddenly something exploded behind us,'' he said. ``my brother was injured in the back.'' the man said he was about 70 feet from the explosion
the blast took place near the end of a daylong celebration that began shortly after dawn with a flag-raising ceremony and a mass, and continued with singing and dancing into the night
earlier, mrs. aquino, defense minister fidel ramos and gen. renato de villa, the military chief of staff, and other senior officials had joined hands with thousands of people for a ``chain of peace'' along edsa. top 11 grafs, picking up in 3rd graf pvs, robertson said</note>
vice president george bush, answering presidential rivals in south carolina, today rejected ``pure, all-out protectionism'' and said existing trade laws are sufficient to help the state's textile industry against foreign imports
bush raised the subject of textiles a day after republican candidate bob dole campaigned in the state and called for passage of legislation restricting foreign textile imports
republican pat robertson has also backed the textile bill and has declared south carolina _ a state where textiles are an important industry _ a major battleground for his campaign
don't go for this pure, all-out protectionism that may save one job and then throw three neighbors in this burgeoning state out of work,'' bush said. ``that isn't the answer.''
he spoke to several hundred students, teachers and others at an assembly at tri-county technical college. he also spoke briefly with students in an industrial electronics class, accompanied by south carolina gov. carroll a. campbell jr., his state campaign chairman
the textile import legislation has support in south carolina and other textile and apparel-producing states of the south. president reagan vetoed similar legislation after it passed congress two years ago
what i propose is that we enforce the law,'' bush said
campaigning wednesday in vermont, bush demanded an apology from robertson for indicating bush's campaign was somehow responsible for the timing of allegations of sexual misconduct against jimmy swaggart, a television evangelist
robertson, however, suggested in louisville, ky., today that if bush had heard exactly what he said there would be no apology demand
i was, frankly, misquoted in the press,'' he said
robertson _ a former television evangelist himself _ said earlier this week he thought it odd that the swaggart controversy erupted just to weeks before super tuesday, when 20 states will choose delegates to the national party conventions, suggesting that the controversy was timed to embarrass him
robertson said he had no proof of political involvement in the swaggart revelations. but in the same interview, robertson accused bush's campaign of ``dirty politics'' and ``trickery.''
by sundown in the old south, i'd like to see him stand up like a southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' bush said wednesday in burlington, vt. ``i'd like to see an apology or proof.''
bush was campaigning today in south carolina, which holds its primary on march 5, three days before the super tuesday contests in 20 states, mostly in the south
bush also expressed puzzlement over another robertson contention _ that his christian broadcasting network at one point had information about the whereabouts of the american hostages in lebanon and that ``they could have been saved.''
robertson spokesmen later said robertson had been referring to passengers and crew members of a twa flight, who were held briefly in lebanon following a 1985 hijacking
my question would be, how come he didn't get a hold of the proper authorities in the united states government that were working day and night, trying to figure out how they could get those people out?'' bush said at a stop in boston
bush, in appearances wednesday in new england, sought to set himself apart from his rivals _ rep. jack kemp, dole, and robertson
you're selecting a president, not a congressman, not a senator, not a preacher,'' he said
on another matter, the vice president said he expected to win in vermont's non-binding presidential primary next tuesday
bush said he did not think his campaign was damaged by a pair of losses in minnesota's gop caucuses and south dakota's primary, both tuesday. dole won in both states
bush's campaign had pulled resources out of south dakota and minnesota in order to concentrate on the contests of march 8, super tuesday
the vice president said he didn't believe the results had any effect on a subject he ``learned the hard way about in 1980 _ momentum.''
during that election, ronald reagan overcame bush's early primary victories to win the republican nomination
reagan, at a nationally broadcast news conference on wednesday night, took the opportunity to defend bush, who has come under questioning on the campaign trail about his role in secret arms sales to iran. bush has refused to detail his advice to the president on the matter, citing confidentiality, but has said he expressed private reservations
reagan corroborated that, adding: ``i don't want to be surrounded by yes men.''
there were reservations, but i'm not going to go into (them) just as he wouldn't go into the private discussions that we may have had,'' the president said
charlotte porter, an editor on the associated press general desk in new york, has been named news editor in the ap's atlanta bureau
carl bell, atlanta chief of bureau, announced the appointment thursday. ms. porter, 33, succeeds mary anne rhyne, who earlier this month was named chief of bureau in hartford, conn
ms. porter, who grew up in lenoir, n.c., was graduated from macalester college in st. paul, minn., and joined the ap in minneapolis in 1976. she worked in the sioux falls and pierre, s.d., offices before transferring to the general desk in 1979. statements.</note>
secretary of state george shultz said today the origins of palestinian rioting in the israeli-occupied west bank are ``essentially indigenous,'' a statement the white house said was consistent with president reagan's assessment that the riots do not appear to be ``home grown.''
shultz, speaking during a flight to jerusalem, where he hopes to amerliorate the conflict in the occupied territories, said, ``it's fundamental origins are essentially indigenous.''
he also told reporters that ``there is an underlying problem consisting of a large number of people in occupation who haven't had the basic rights of governance.''
hours earlier, reagan said at a nationally televised news conference that ``there is every evidence that these riots are not just spontaneous and home grown.''
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater, asked about the two men's statements, said, ``those are totally consistent.''
the president said the same thing,'' fitzwater told reporters. ``he just said they (the riots) were partly influenced by outside sources.''
he is saying that it is indigenous in the nature of the political problem there but there has been some outside influence as well,'' the spokesman said. ``he is saying exactly what we have said all along.''
fifty-nine people have died since the rioting began, most of them shot by israeli troops
reagan said, ``we have had intimations that there have been certain people suspected of being terrorists, outsiders coming in, not only with weapons, but stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those areas.''
asked about saying the riots were not ``home grown,'' reagan added:
that isn't something you can go out and say we absolutely know, but certainly the violence is both ways.''
shultz said intelligence showed ``a mixed picture'' with ``interaction with outside force.''
but he said ``there is an underlying problem consisting of a large number of people in occupation who haven't had the basic rights of governance. so we seek among other things consistent with israel's security, to look at things that will help palestinians gain legitimate rights.''
reagan offered no evidence to support his assertion that outsiders and terrorists are to blame for the violence, saying security rules prevented him from doing so
he declined to criticize israel's policy of beating large numbers of palestinians and occasionally firing on the protestors
but he said, ``we don't support that sort of thing and we are trying to persuade all the participants to try to arrive at a solution representing justice for all.''
reagan added that ``we have spoken to the government there and we have also spoken to the palestinian leadership because there is every evidence that these riots are not just spontaneous and home-grown.''
previously, administration officials had not given any indication that any outside involvement was suspected in the rioting
the president said ``it's time for us to arrive at a true peace and recognize the rights of all'' in the middle east
he said peace in the middle east ``would be one of the greatest achievements of this administration.''
reagan did not go into detail about u.s. proposals, but israeli officials have already said they oppose two elements. one part is an international conference in april to seek an interim solution in the occupied territories, while the second is a december date for talks to begin on a final settlement
the president said ``it's time for all parties to rid themselves of old ideas and stances that cannot work and to begin a serious process of negotiation and reconciliation.''
any process that is undertaken must meet israel's security needs and satisfy the legitimate rights of the palestinians,'' he said
india successfully test-fired its first surface-to-surface missile thursday, prime minister rajiv gandhi announced in parliament
the missile has a range of 155 miles, used a computer-aided navigation system and could be fitted with different warheads, the united news of india reported
the new missile _ named ``prithvi,'' the hindu word for earth _ was designed by scientists at the government-owned defense research and development organization, the news agency said
gandhi did not say where the test took place
he said india was the fifth country in the world to successfully develop this class of missile, the others being the united states, the soviet union, france and china
in april, india tested its first domestically produced surface-to-air missile. india exploded a nuclear device in 1974, but says its atomic program is for peaceful purposes
the government destroyed more than 41,000 acres of illicit poppies last year, it was reported thursday
the state-owned working people's daily said the government also seized 3,250 pounds of raw opium, 178 pounds of heroin and 66 pounds of morphine base during 1987
the poppies were destroyed both by hand and by aerial spraying of herbicides, it said
in 1986, the government destroyed more than 40,000 acres of poppies and seized 3,900 pounds of raw opium, 105 pounds of heroin and 63 pounds of morphine base, the newspaper said
the opium is grown mostly by hill tribes in eastern burma and refined into heroin by armed trafficking groups operating along the thai-burmese border
it was one of those days for the daily telegraph
the masthead of the wednesday's editions of the newspaper mistakenly said it was thursday, and it reportedly caused havoc throughout the land
the telegraph reported on thursday's front page that one reader complained he had traveled to birmingham a day too soon after being misled by wednesday's paper
someone else went to the dentist a day early, and some elderly readers went to post offices to collect pensions that normally arrive on thursday
several hundred people called to point out the mistake, the paper said
the majority were puzzled and confused,'' it quoted switchboard operator rita sherman as saying. ``but some were very annoyed and upset, particularly those who had traveled all over the place thinking it was thursday and got there before they found out. but a nice cross-section saw a funny side to it.''
the telegraph said the misprint in 300,000 copies of wednesday's final edition

more than 75 percent of the 4.6 million tons in food aid needed this year by sub-saharan africa already has been pledged, but ethiopia remains threatened by famine, a u.n. group said thursday
thirty-five of sub-sahara's 42 countries still have unmet food aid needs of 1 million tons, according to a report issued in nairobi by the rome-based u.n. food and agriculture organization
nine of those countries _ angola, benin, botswana, chad, ethiopia, madagascar, malawi, mozambique and niger _ will require exceptional emergency relief, the statement said
althoe than 1 million of the 1.3 million tons of food aid needed by drought-stricken ethiopia, relief operations there face logistical problems, the report said

the federal election commission said today it is all right for a presidential campaign to write off half the cost of a tv ad as a fund-raising expense even if the overt money solicitation is only a tiny part of the commercial
in its 4-2 decision, the commission signaled to the presidential campaigns that it will allow a practice that some critics have said is a method of evading the state spending limits imposed on the campaigns
dissenting from the ruling, commissioner joan aikens said the agency was merely ``sanctioning creative accounting to get around the limits.''
i think we are absolutely blowing the state limits out of the water,'' she said
but other commission members said the fec should not be getting involved with scrutinizing every campaign ad to determine what portion contained a fund-raising appeal
commissioner thomas josefiak said that even if an ad appears to be mostly issue-related, as long as it has an overt fund-raising message as well as information on how to contribute _ such as a telephone number to call _ the ad can be considered to have a dual purpose. in that case, a 50 percent allocation for fund-raising would be appropriate, the commission determined
fund-raising allocations are important to presidential campaigns because they are not counted against the federally mandated limits on spending in each state
the opinion comes in answer to a query from sen. albert gore jr., the democratic contender from tennessee, whose staff complained about the approach used in ioa by rivals rep. richard gephardt of missouri and massachusetts gov. michael dukakis
the issue involves how much of the costs of tv ads can be excluded from the total that a campaign spends against an expenditure ceiling in each state. fund-raising costs are not counted against the cap, which in iowa this year was $775,000
gore did not mention the other campaigns in his request for an fec opinion, but posed his question as a hypothetical involving a 60-second ad for his own campaign, with a fund-raising appeal in the last three seconds
gore asked if he could count only 50 percent of that ad's cost against the cap. the legal counsel's opinion was that 5 percent would be a more reasonable figure
gore's hypothetical paralleled gephardt's commercial in iowa in which the final seconds contained the request for viewers to ``vote, volunteer, contribute.'' gephardt excluded half the cost from the spending his campaign allocated to iowa
such a practice is valuable in iowa because all of the campaigns wanted to spend large sums to get high visibility in the nation's first democratic caucus
dukakis also ran ads that contained only a brief fund-raising appeal at the end, with the rest of the ad focused on issues, and he counted 40 percent as fund-raising
in response to gore's question, the fec legal staff said that writing off part of the ads as a fund-raising expense is legitimate. but the opinion said the write-off should be generally proportional to the portion of the ad that contains a fund-raising message
the fec opinion by counsel larry noble said that a 50 percent writeoff for that would not be reasonable
given that the only appeal to contribute occurs in the final three seconds of the 60-second spot, an allocation of 5 percent (or less) to the exclusion would be reasonable,'' the opinon said
the gephardt and dukakis campaigns had cited the precedent of sen. john glenn's presidential campaign in 1984, in which the fec allowed a 50 percent fund-raising writeoff for glenn's half-hour tv show
noble's opinion noted that the fec decides such matters on a case-by-case basis
campaigns use the fec case-specific rulings, however, as guidelines for their own activities
president reagan broke his silence about the candidates vying for his job, slapping out at republican pat robertson, defending vice president george bush and ridiculing the democrats, saying, ``the kids will play.''
the president, in fielding questions wednesday night at his first news conference in four months, also gave strong backing to his embattled attorney general, edwin meese, saying, ``i have every confidence in his integrity.''
however, reagan refused to comment on the investigation of meese's role in a proposed middle east oil pipeline. reagan said he had no recollection of knowing about the pipeline deal until recently
a relaxed reagan opened with a smile, saying ``on the networks at last'' _ a gibe at abc, cbs and nbc for refusing to broadcast his feb. 2 speech appealing for contra aid
however, he appeared uncomfortable at times, saying he was not aware of federal reserve chairman alan greenspan's complaint in senate testimony earlier wednesday that the administration was putting too much election-year pressure on the fed to lower interest rates
in his testimony, greenspan was highly critical of a letter sent by assistant treasury secretary michael darby to top fed policy-makers 10 days before they were to meet to set monetary growth targets for 1988
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater, asked today if the administration agreed with greenspan, said, ``yes, we do. we have the highest regard for chairman greenspan and the work he's doing, (we're) very concerned about any pressure being applied to the fed because they are an independent body, doing an outstanding job.''
at his news conference, reagan also contradicted his own previous statements and those of secretary of state george shultz and former defense secretary caspar weinberger by claiming the two had not objected to the secret sale of arms to iran on grounds it was an arms-for-hostages deal
shultz and weinberger have said otherwise, and the iran-contra report issued by two congressional committees said the secretaries ``called it a straight arms-for-hostages deal that was contrary to u.s. public policy.''
brushing aside questions on the seemingly differing statements, fitzwater said today, ``i don't feel they need any reconciliation. these are all matters of interpretation.''
reagan has tried from the start of the political campaign to steer clear of the presidential race, but he suddenly switched course with an open slap at robertson
the former television evangelist had said earlier in the day that his own christian broadcasting network once knew the whereabouts of american hostages in lebanon ``and they could have been freed'' if the united states had acted promptly
in reply, reagan said that if robertson knew where the hostages were being held, ``he kept it to himself.'' the president said it would be ``very strange'' if it happened the way robertson described it
as for the plight of the nine americans now held in lebanon, reagan declared, ``we've never let up, and we never will'' in trying to obtain their freedom
robertson, campaigning in louisville, ky., said today that reporters for his network did have hostage information in 1985, that he offered the information to the major television networks and that he was then contacted by low-level state department officials
reacting to reagan's skepticism, he said, ``i wasn't meaning to start some major confrontation with a person i admire tremendously, but obviously the state department must have dismissed what we had to say, or else they didn't refer it up the line to the president.''
in defense of bush, reagan corroborated the vice president's claim that he had expressed private reservations about selling arms to iran
the president said he put down orders that ``i don't want to be surrounded by `yes' men. and, yes, there were reservations, but i'm not going to go into (them) just as he wouldn't go into the private discussions that we may have had.''
asked about democrats' charges that his administration has been plagued by corruption, reagan sidestepped the question and instead accused democrats of misrepresenting his administration's record on the economy
if anyone listened for more than 15 minutes to their candidates, he would decide that we're in an economic slump, we're burdened by inflation, high interest rates and unemployment when, at the moment, none of those things are true. ..
so, i just think that, you know, the kids will play, and as long as they want to do that, but i hope it'll easily be forgotten.''
reagan's meeting with reporters coincided with shultz's departure for the middle east to try to get arab-israeli peace talks moving
it's time for all parties to rid themselves of old ideas and stances that cannot work and to begin a serious process of negotiation and reconciliation,'' reagan said
any process that is undertaken must meet israel's security needs and satisfy the legitimate rights of the palestinians.''
he said there is ``every evidence'' that outside terrorists have been stirring up trouble in the israeli-occupied west bank and gaza strip. he refused to say who he was talking about. fitzwater today insisted there was no difference between what reagan said and shultz's claim that the problem was largely indigenous
pointedly, reagan passed up several opportunities to criticize israel's crackdown on arab protestors in which more than 50 palestinians have been killed. reagan's strongest statement on the subject was ``we don't support that sort of thing.''
on other topics, reagan:
_said shultz had given him an ``encouraging'' report on his just-completed trip to the soviet union. during the talks in moscow, shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze set a one-month deadline for arms negotiators to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons
_said that a democratic proposl limiting aid to the contras to ``humanitarian'' assistance was ``fine, and then we'll take our chances'' on another attempt at getting military aid for the rebels
_said he had not decided whether to tell congress that aid should be resumed to panama. to do that, he has to certify that panama is helping in anti-drug efforts, but gen. manuel antonio noriega, panama's military leader, has been indicted on u.s. drug-trafficking charges

two journalists were charged with defaming the army and the defense minister after reporting he tried to sell arms to famine-stricken ethiopia instead of offering aid, state television said
france zavrl, chief editor of the slovenian mladina youth weekly, and andrej novak, a journalist of the teleks weekly, were charged with ``offending and disdaining'' the army and adm. branko mamula, the defense minister, in published articles, state television said
mamula has faced tough criticism in a series of articles published in the liberal republic of slovenia for his february visit to ethiopia
the articles said that mamula traveled to ethiopia in order to sell arms instead of offering food and financial aid
the charges against the journalists followed a recent sharp statement issued by yugoslavia's collective presidency, which called for action against frequent press attacks on the army and its leadership

u.s. secretary of state george p. shultz today blamed longtime israeli occupation, not outside agitation, for the violent unrest in the west bank and gaza strip
shultz said, ``its fundamental origins are essentially indigenous.''
president reagan, at a news conference wednesday night, blamed ``terrorists'' and ``outsiders'' he did not identify for the violence in the israeli-held territories, which israel seized in the 1967 middle east war. he cited intelligence reports but gave no details
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today that the statements of reagan and shultz were ``totally consistent.''
the president said the same thing,'' fitzwater said. ``he just said they (the riots) were partly influenced by outside sources. ... he is saying that it is indigenous in the nature of the political problems there but there has been some outside influence as well.''
shultz flew to jerusalem today with u.s. proposals for an overall mideast settlement
he said intelligence showed ``a mixed picture'' with ``interaction with outside force.'' but he added, ``there is an underlying problem consisting of a large number of people in occupation who haven't had the basic rights of governance
so we seek among other things consistent with israel's security, to look at things that will help palestinians gain legitimate rights.''
shultz defended his decision to stop in syria while in the middle east
in the past, he accused syria of terrorism and said the united states should try to isolate the country. sanctions were imposed in 1986, including a ban on meetings between high-level u.s. and syrian officials
in the first place, the syrian involvement in terrorism seems to have diminished, and we have had some definite moves that have been made that we found encouraging,'' he said
i don't mean to say that the problem is resolved,'' shultz added, but he said the united states had realized how important a role syria plays in the region
so we will go there and hear what they have to say and tell them what we have to say, recognizing their significance,'' he said
shultz also seemed to disagree with reagan over the iran-contra affair
the president said shultz and former defense secretary caspar weinberger had objected to the secret sale of u..s arms to iran, not because it amounted to a trade for american hostages held in lebanon but because it could be perceived that way
shultz, asked about the statement during a refueling stop here on the way to israel, did not directly challenge reagan but said, ``i've testified and i really don't have anything to add or subtract becasue my testimony is based to a very healthy extent on records and notes and so on.''
shultz testified in private and in public that he had opposed the u.s. arms sales to iran because it had amounted to trading weapons for hostages
he said the investigations had not brought out any other argument by him and weinberger against the sale
queen elizabeth ii, whose personal fortune is a closely guarded secret, is britain's richest person worth an estimated $5.87 billion, according to a list of the nation's 200 richest people
the list was front-page news in london on thursday, with racy tabloid headlines ranging from ``filthy rich'' in the sun to ``millionaires galore'' in the daily mail
money magazine, which complied the list, said the second-wealthiest briton as 92-year-old sir john moores, founder of the littlewoods soccer pools empire, a weekly game for small-time gamblers based on soccer results. it estimated his fortune at $2.99 billion
it listed the third-wealthiest briton as supermarket chain owner garfield weston, 60, chairman of associated british foods, with an estimated personal fortune at $2.64 billion
in fourth place is the 36-year-old duke of westminster. his inherited holdings include large chunks of highly desireable real estate in central london, huge tracts of farmland and sweeping acres of remote northern moorland. the magazine said his personal fortune was about $2.46 billion
money magazine says britain has seven billionaires, 18 families and individuals worth more than $440 million each, and 20,000 millionaires as measured in pounds
the magazine's estimate of the 61-year-old queen's wealth makes her the world's eighth-richest individual. it said the world's richest person is the sultan of brunei, with an estimated fortune equivalent to $24.64 billion
the guinness book of records lists the richest person in the united states as sam moore walton, founder of wal-mart discount stores in bentonville, ark., whose personal wealth was estimated in mid-1987 at $4.5 billion ``and rising.''
money magazine said financier sir james goldsmith _ fifth in its list of britain's wealthiest 200 with an estimated $1.76 billion _ was the only british billionaire to have made all his money since the end of world war ii in 1945
the youngest person in the top 200 is 31-year-old sophie mirman, with an estimated $52.8 million. she and her husband, richard ross, created the popular sock shop chain
among the 12 women in the top 200 list are ``dynasty'' star joan collins and her sister, jackie collins, the author of a string of best-selling raunchy novels. it said they are worth an estimated $26.4 million between them
editor sue thomas said it took six months to compile the list, ``consulting public sources of information and talking extensively to analysts in the city,'' london's financial district
the people we did not talk to were the 200 themselves because we wanted to keep the list under wraps until the last possible minute. many of the super-rich are very secretive,'' she said
asked how it estimated the queen's wealth in view of the secrecy maintained by her london bankers, coutts and co., mrs. thomas said: ``we found out as much as we could about the different headings under which her wealth falls _ her castles and other properties, her land holdings, her vast share portfolio, her stamp collection, her art collection, her jewelry collection and so forth and we talked to a lot of people with information
we arrived at what we estimate to be a minimum net worth for all the people on our list.''
it said 53 of the 200 fortunes stemmed from property. five percent of those listed came from abroad and only 15 percent belong to the british aristocracy. the self-made rich outnumbered those who inherited their wealth by 2-1
a french company has ordered american subsidiaries to sell nearly 1 million acres of timberland from maine to new york, officials said today
general occidentale wants to sell 800,000 acres of diamond occidental forest inc. land in maine, as well diamond international corp. holdings totaling 90,000 acres in new hampshire and vermont and nearly 96,000 acres in new york
the asking price totals more than $200 million, said robert whitney, executive vice president of landvest inc., a boston-based timberland broker marketing the land in new york, vermont and new hampshire
it would be the largest such land sale in the region since at least 1960, whitney said
a spokesman for the diamond companies, based in old town, maine, would not comment today on the proposed sale of the maine woodland. daniel christensen did confirm the proposed sale of the new york, vermont and new hampshire land
whitney said the land probably would continue to be used for timbering, and said general occidentale hopes to find single buyers for each of the three packages. the company decided to let its subsidiary market the maine package itself, he said
these 90,000 acres in new hampshire and vermont and 96,000 acres in new york state were too small for them to get involved in marketing directly,'' whitney said. ``they're used to dealing in $100 million transactions.''
the asking prices are $18.5 million for the new york package, $19 million for the new hampshire-vermont land, and at least $170 million for the maine land, whitney said in a telephone interview from landvest's office in portland, maine
he said he expected likely buyers would be pension funds or investment syndicates interested in stable returns from timber sales. congress told</head>
child health in the united states could be improved through a number of steps ranging from an expanded medicaid program to child seat-belt requirements, a congressional report said thursday
the office of technology assessment, which advises congress on scientific matters, also recommended better access to medical care for poor children and pregnant women; newborn screening for several disorders; and well-child care for those up to age 6
ota said other promising approaches are school-based health clinics and visiting nurse programs for families in which there is a high risk of child abuse or the birth of low-birthweight babies
judith wagner, a senior assosciate at ota, told the house energy and commerce subcommittee on health and environment that the united states ranked 17th among industrialized nations in infant mortality, a position that showed no improvement in the past five years
wagner also said more than 20 percent of 2-year-olds were not immunized against measles in 1985. he said poor children bear a disproportionate share of illness and death, and a substantial number of children do not have health insurance
ota said it would be both effective and cost-saving to improve access to early prenatal care for poor women, encourage immunizations and preventive care for young children, and encourage the use of child safety restraints in automobiles
the office said expanded newborn screening and universal medicaid eligibility for poor children would effectively improve child health, although they would not necessarily save money
ota recommended further study of two other approaches it characterized as promising: visiting nurses for high-risk families and comprehensive school clinics that offer family planning services to adolescents at risk of unwanted pregnancy
wagner said studies of two school-based clinics show they have achieved some success in reducing pregnancy and birth rates. she said congress should seek more information on ``this rapidly growing approach to delivering health services to high-risk teen-agers.''
congress has been moving in recent years to include more pregnant women and children in the medicaid system. subcommittee chairman henry waxman, d-calif., said thursday he would introduce legislation next week that includes several of ota's suggestions. leader was armenian. pick up 28th pvs, `a later...'</note>
thousands of people demonstrated today in the armenian capital, yerevan, while the soviet army sent in troops and tanks to quell protests over a disputed area in neighboring azerbaidzhan, witnesses said
armenians in nagorno-karabakh virtually shut down the disputed area with a strike, travelers from the area said. some residents said armenians had been killed
mofses gorgiskyan, a resident of yerevan, said in a telephone interview that more than 1 million people were demonstrating there today, but the report could not be verified. he said they demanded that armenian authorities act on their demand that nagorno-karabakh be made part of armenia
soldiers arrived in the morning and took up discreet positions in downtown yerevan, particularly around key government buildings, gorgiskyan said. they also deployed camouflaged trucks downtown and stationed tanks in outlying areas, he said
gorgiskyan said some azeris, members of the main nationality of azerbaidzhan, threw stones at a bus in an outlying area of nagorno-karabakh on tuesday and killed an undetermined number of armenians. azeris also set fire to a school, resulting in other deaths, he said
gorgiskyan described himself as a 26-year-old member of an underground group called the alliance for national determination
in nagorno-karabakh, virtually the entire armenian population, about 120,000, has been demonstrating in the main city since feb. 13, said a 17-year-old resident
there was no way to verify the reports independently because the government barred foreign reporters from traveling to the area
the resident, a student, also said some armenians had been killed by azeris, but she could offer no details
three-quarters of the residents of nagorno-karabakh are armenians. the demonstrators are demanding that armenia's nominal parliament support demands that nagorno-karabakh be removed from azerbaidzhan and turned over to armenia
the resident, a student interviewed in moscow after flying from armenia, spoke on condition she not be identified. she said she saw a crowd gathered this morning in lenin square in nagorno-karabakh's main city, stepanakert
practically the whole population is there. they've come from all the villages,'' said the student
the student confirmed that authorities brought in extra forces at one point during the 12 days of demonstrations, but she said she believed they were militiamen, not army troops
another armenian interviewed at moscow's vnukovo airport estimated that 1,000 people were demonstrating this morning outside the opera house in yerevan
the demonstrations in nagorno-karabakh were continuing around the clock and schools and businesses were closed in a strike, said the student. ``no one's sleeping. no one is going to work. the only stores open are groceries,'' she said
an official at the armenian representational offices in moscow in charge of internal matters, rudolf khatchyanov, told the associated press that a major demonstration by armenians continued in yerevan. but he said he had no details
repeated calls to yerevan were broken off after only a few seconds or did not go through at all
paruyr ayrikyan, an armenian activist in yerevan, said wednesday that 200,000 people demonstrated in the capital's central square, demanding that the republic's parliament convene to resolve the dispute
armenian officials had proposed annexing the mountainous territory, but the party's national central committee earlier this month decided nagorno-karabakh should remain part of azerbaidzhan
on wednesday, the kremlin named an armenian, genrikh pogosyan, communist party chief in the area
an armenian activist in moscow, sergei grigoryants, praised the appointment, but said it would not likely quell the protests
this was the first test of the ability of the country's leaders to work out a compromise to a difficult situation involving nationalities,'' grigoryants said
but he said armenian demonstrators are angered over what they see as unconstitutional interference by the party
the demonstrators already have deemed this matter outside the party's control,'' grigoryants said
demonstrations by armenians against control by azeris began late last week after the party's decision was announced, ayrikyan said
the soviet army sent in tanks and troops as a show of force, and rumors spread to yerevan that some armenian demonstrators were killed in the melee that ensued, said ayrikyan
tass announced wednesday night that pogosyan had been named party leader in the disputed region. tass said pogosyan was armenian and born in nagorno-karabakh. his predecessor, boris kevorkov, also is armenian
a later tass report said party leaders in yerevan met and voiced support for the central committee decision to keep nagorno-karabakh in azerbaidzhan. the party meeting also issued orders to local officials to take all steps necessary to end the protests
nagorno-karabakh is 1,760 square miles, smaller than the state of delaware. czechoslovakia</head>
communist officials and the state-run press said thursday that soviet troops began withdrawing ss-12 nuclear missiles from this town, where hundreds of people waved flags and showered troops with gifts
women pressed flowers on 150 soviet soldiers and children gave them books, candy and other gifts in an orchestrated, two-hour ceremony at the train station. the troops have been here four years
as the train loaded with 32 canvas-wrapped containers pulled away, the soldiers waved at the crowd and pressed the bouquets to the windows
east german officials at the scene and the state-run adn news agency said the containers held parts of dismantled ss-12 missiles and that the train was headed to the soviet union, where the missiles would be destroyed
western diplomats were skeptical
until the arms treaty is in place, there is no way of confirming what we are seeing, and what we are being told is actually what it all appears to be,'' said one western diplomat, who asked not to be identified
in neighboring czechoslovakia, the state-run ctk news agency said soviet ss-12 missiles were withdrawn from the town of hranice, southeast of prague. it said a train carrying soviet troops and 19 missile launchers left hranice en route to the soviet union
the commander of czechoslovak missile units and artillery, lt. gen. jan krizan, was quoted by ctk as saying that hranice was the only place in czechoslovakia where ss-12s were deployed
the shorter-range missiles, which have a range of 300 to 600 miles, would be the first nuclear weapons to be removed from central europe under terms of a superpower arms treaty signed in washington last december
soviet officials proclaimed the early withdrawal an ``act of trust'' that the u.s. congress would approve the accord
military bands played and more than 1,000 residents waved small east german, soviet and communist party flags in bischofswerda, a city of about 12,000 near the czechoslovak and polish borders
some people carried banners reading, ``an early missile withdrawal _ proof of our will for peace,'' and ``long live the soviet-german friendship.''
fifty-four ss-12 missiles have been based in east germany, at four separate sites, since 1983. they were deployed after nato deployed pershing 2 and cruise missiles in western europe
this is an act of building trust,'' said lt. igor vladimirovich obraszov, soviet commander of one of the missile batteries
scores of east german soldiers were also on hand
thank god they're leaving,'' said one east german army lieutenant, referring to the soviet missiles. ``for the past four years i have had to accept being a possible target of a western attack.''
the soldiers posed for photographers, shook hands with local residents and tried to answer questions in halting english or german
it is always good to be going home,'' said 1st lt. taras durayesky, a career army officer from odessa as he boarded the train. ``this is a good country, but i have been here four years.''
more than 150 reporters watched the ceremony
ctk said 60 reporters were watching the removal of missiles from hranice, but no western journalists were invited

     ...   with the university of texas as the guest team
it's appropriate that texas be the opponent because the longhorns suffered some deep miseries in the airish, dank building where you could catch a cold even if you had just been cured of one
perhaps the worst night was when mike wacker, center of an unbeaten longhorns' team, slipped on a wet spot and so tore up his knee that it ended any chance of an nba career
like a curse from some egyptian tomb, the voodooed longhorns sank to a miserable season, giving abe lemons' detractors their chance to fire him
the next year when texas visited, one baylor coach wanted to shake the 'horns by putting a black x where wacker fell. but more tasteful and cooler heads prevailed
spooky things always happened at h.o.t. of course, there was the first rain delay in college basketball history this year when the roof leaked, holding up play
but that was small trick-or-treat stuff compared to one game i remember years ago involving the visiting texas a&amp;m aggies
i believe an aggie was at the free throw line when a late-running baylor tuba player crashed his automobile into the power pole outside
it plunged h.o.t into darker darkness
the place had always been so dim that rival coaches threatened to issue their players coal miners' lamps
of course, a&amp;m coach shelby metcalf was fit to be fried. the lights never were restored to full power. the aggies finally agreed to play the game out under eerie, twilight zone conditions. they lost
you had to listen for the swish to know you made one,'' metcalf quipped
powers failures were always numerous in h.o.t
more than one deadline was blown by electrical outages which sent stories to editorial graveyards. one sports writer slam-dunked his chair into the stands in one outage outrage
more recently, the baylor mascot knocked a dallas radio off the air briefly by stumbling over an electrical cord
just getting into the building could be fun. i recall arriving at a game early for prime position on gravel within several blocks of the coliseum on a rainy evening
feeling smug, i advanced to within 25 yards of the building before almost disappearing in a mud hole large enough to lose a shetland pony
baylor always had a big advantage in this ``pit.''
the bears at least knew where the dim rims could be found. crowd seating on the floor also gave the bears a huge psychological edge
but baylor was hurt in the recruting wars because of the decaying coliseum
former coach jim haller always liked to talk about school academics and such on recruiting visits. he knew he was dead if he had to take the kid to the barn
baylor's ``dressing room'' to this day is a trailer parked at one end of the coliseum
once a goal weighing hundreds of pounds fell to the floor only 20 feet from where pam davis' baylor womens' team was exercising. another time a retaining wall collapsed just yards away from where spectators were seated
at least the building had a heart: nobody was ever killed in it
the bears' new coliseum is expected to be ready for coach gene iba next fall. it's going to be a compact 9,000-seater which will put the fans within easy shouting distance of the opponents' ear pans
baylor recruiting should be a lot easier, but opponents will never have the fear they had amidst the spiders and cobwebs in h.o.t
it was the pit of pits, but on march 5th will become a nostalgic page in southwest conference basketball history
an 82-year-old house built by an explorer, engineer and naturalist will become the new home of the institute that supports naturalist jane goodall, famous for her 28 years of chimpanzee research
a variance allowing the jane goodall institute to use the house for its offices, a museum and a classroom was approved wednesday by the tucson board of adjustment
the house was built by godfrey sykes, founder of the local desert laboratory. he named it dar es salaam after the east african port city he visited in 1912, said georgiana boyer, sykes' granddaughter. she said the name means ``haven of peace'' in arabic
dar es salaam also happens to be where ms. goodall lives when she's not following chimpanzees in gombe stream national park in tanzania
i was amazed, just totally amazed _ it just seemed unreal _ when i heard that this house was called dar es salaam,'' ms. goodall said in a telephone interview from washington, d.c
the institute functions as goodall's u.s. office and arranges her annual lecture tour
the new headquarters will include a museum and a library featuring ms. goodall's handwritten field notebooks of chimpanzee behavior
commerce secretary c. william verity urged lawmakers thursday to produce a major trade bill but not resort to protectionism, while a senate chairman reported progress in drafting such a measure
i think we should have a trade bill and it should be a good trade bill,'' verity told the house foreign affairs committee. he urged the lawmakers to avoid protectionism and praised them for moving to soften a senate provision that would ban u.s. sales of toshiba products
the senate included its toshiba provision last year following reports that a subsidiary of the japanese electronics producer had sold sophisticated submarine-silencing technology to the soviet union
the administration, however, has been a critic of the provision, and house negotiators have proposed to leave the decision up to the president
we believe that would be the correct approach,'' verity said
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen, d-texas, said house-senate negotiators had dropped ``foreign policy'' provisions from a compromise version of the two chambers' trade bills
he did not specify which provisions that involved, although house negotiators on tuesday proposed to delete a feature that would strip romania of its guarantee of trade relations with the united states that are as good as those enjoyed by any other country. proponents say the provision would prod romania to improve its emigration policies
particular interest has focused on a house offer to drop a provision of both measures that would allow a handful of sugar refining companies to collect from the government $400 million in tariffs paid years ago on sugar imports that since then have been refined and re-exported
among other matters facing the senators is a house proposal to drop import curbs on lamb. the feature, contained only in the senate bill, was sponsored by one of the conferees, sen. max baucus, d-mont., who emerged from the meeting and declared that ``real progress has been made'' but provided no specifics
in other trade action, lawmakers from wheat-producing states sharply questioned agriculture secretary richard lyng and u.s. trade representative clayton k. yeutter at a house agriculture committee hearing
the two secretaries were there to discuss the proposed free-trade agreement between the united states and canada. one provision of the agreement would end canadian transportation subsidies for wheat shipped to vancouver but leave untouched a subsidy for shipments to the big grain port at thunder bay, ontario. transporation costs are a key factor in grain prices
american wheat growers have been complaining that the thunder bay payments also should have been eliminated under the treaty, whose major provisions would phase out tariffs between the united states and canada
lyng and yeutter reiterated previous pledges to consider the thunder bay issue in future negotiations and repeated what they said in earlier clashes, namely that the pact represents an improvement in u.s.-canadian trade relations as well as being the best deal that american negotiators could get
but that did not satisfy some lawmakers
are you still looking after the interests of u.s. agricultural producers?'' said rep. ron marlenee, r-mont
i would give an emphatic yes,'' lyng responded
tibetan buddhists thursday began their most important religious festival, an 11-day celebration that was nearly canceled because of fears of a repetition of last fall's violent anti-chinese demonstrations
foreign sources in lhasa, the capital of tibet, said the start of the moinlam qenmo festival passed without incident, although some monks were reluctant to attend the ceremonies and some people stayed away to avoid possible trouble
an indian tourist guide in lhasa, contacted by phone, said some monks didn't want to participate because they said fellow monks, who led the pro-independence riots in september and october, were still detained by chinese police
the guide, who refused to give his name, said there was division in the tibetan community over whether to hold the religious rites as usual this year. he could not confirm reports that some monks boycotted the festival
china's official media earlier said 80 people, including monks, were detained following the disturbances in which about 14 people lost their lives. official reports said almost all had been released after repenting their actions in the riots
a tibetan-speaking american, who has been in lhasa four months, said the city was ``a little tense'' thursday with uniformed and plainclothes police on patrol. he said he saw police in riot gear at the johkang temple where the main ceremonies for the holiday are taking place
the american, who also refused to give his name, said foreigners have been told to return to their hotels by 10 p.m., and that police have posted signs in english warning foreigners not to photograph or participate in disturbances
the official xinhua news agency reported from lhasa that ceremonies marking the start of moinlam qenmo began when two lamas, or monks, blew blasts on large trumpets from the johkang temple in the center of the city
xinhua said about 1,000 monks gathered at the temple to mark the annual ``grand summons'' ceremony, and that about 1,000 people watched in the square outside the temple
the news agency said that with the blowing of the trumpets dozens of believers threw letters of good wishes tied with silk scarves to the presiding lama and begged him to pray for their happiness
inside the temple, one of tibetan buddhism's holiest sites, thousands of lamps glowed while monks prayed to zong kaba, founder of the yellow sect of tibetan lamaism who started the ceremony in 1409
the panchem lama, tibet's second-holiest man after the exiled dalai lama, revealed last month that officials had considered canceling the festival because of fears that the arrival of thousands of pilgrims from other parts of tibet would lead to a new outbreak of violence
the communists, which took control over tibet in 1950, claims the remote mountainous region has been an integral part of china for centuries
however, there has long been considerable friction between the tibetans and the hans who are the dominant ethnic group of china, particularly as a result of the 1966-76 cultural revolution when leftist red guards destroyed temples, suppressed local customs and language, and persecuted religious believers
china blames the recent disturbances on the dalai lama, who fled to india following an unsuccessful 1959 uprising and continues to speak out against what he says are china's oppressive policies in tibet
the beijign government has also accused the u.s. congress, which has called on china to stop human rights violations in tibet, of meddling in its internal affairs
china has said it made mistakes during the cultural revolution and has tried to make amends by rebuilding temples, guaranteeing religious freedom and paying for development of the region, one of the poorest in the country
the army unveiled plans thursday for cutting officer strength in a budget move, including appointment of a board to select more than 350 colonels and lieutenant colonels for early retirement
the service said it also was beginning a voluntary release program for all officers regardless of rank who wanted to leave the military, and would strictly enforce guidelines specifying the discharge of any first lieutenant who fails for a second time to win promotion to captain
the army disclosed last week in its fiscal 1989 budget proposal that it was cutting active-duty strength by 8,600, including about 1,540 officers. the cuts _ down to a total strength of roughly 772,000 _ were prompted by a deficit-reduction agreement reached with congress last november
earlier this month, the army said it would trim its enlisted ranks through a combination of early discharges for soldiers who were already preparing to leave the service and reductions in recruiting goals
the service said thursday it had now begun focusing on the officer community and hoped the combination of the three new programs would allow it to reduce those ranks without causing undue personal hardship
lt. col. greg rixon, an army spokesman, said the service expected between 750 and 800 officers to resign or retire as part of normal attrition. to make up the difference toward the new target, he said:
_the army will convene a selective early retirement board in may to pick 178 colonels and 181 lieutenant colonels for retirement. these are officers who have already served at least 20 years, and thus are eligible for a pension, but had not planned to retire yet. those selected by the board will have to retire by nov. 30
as of last sept. 30, the army had 4,647 colonels and 11,120 lieutenant colonels
_the army will immediately start a voluntary release program for all commissioned officers. under this program, an officer who decides he is ready to leave the military _ but who still ``owes'' time under a special obligation _ will be allowed to resign or retire anyway
the special obligations involve extra commitments of service stemming from such things as advanced schooling or acceptance of lengthy overseas tours
younger officers who were ``commissioned through a service academy, rotc or officer candidate school may have up to 12 months of their service obligation waived, in exchange for 12 months of commitment in a national guard or army reserve unit,'' rixon added
_strict ``involuntary release,'' or dismissal, for certain first lieutenants no later than sept. 30. rixon said a younger officer who is passed over twice for promotion is normally discharged in any event. under the new program, however, there will be no possibility of a waiver that would allow the officer to remain
president reagan plans to nominate barbara mcconnell barrett of phoenix, ariz., as deputy administrator of the federal aviation administration, the white house announced thursday
ms. barrett, 37, has been a partner in a phoenix law firm since 1985. she was vice chairman of the civil aeronautics board in 1983 and 1984. she is also a former corporate attorney for the greyhound corp
the white house also announced that the president will nominate kenneth j. beirne, a former executive director of the republican party of kentucky, as assistant secretary of housing and urban development for policy development and research
after his service in the party position in 1981, beirne, 41, served in a variety of positions at hud. he has been a free-lance writer since last year, the white house said
reagan will appoint robert b. barker, a former executive of the lawrence livermore national laboratory, to the new position of assistant to the secretary of defense for atomic energy
barker, 48, was with the arms control and disarmament agency from 1983 to 1985 and has been working on atomic energy matters at the pentagon since then. he was at livermore for 10 years before coming to washington
alex r. munson, 46, of saipan, north mariana islands, chief justice of the high court for the trust territory of the pacific islands since 1982, will be nominated as judge of the district court for the northern mariana islands, the announcement said. attack, details on surrender and conditions; no pickup; adds byline.</note>
a man who had been evicted from a retirement home burst into a board meeting at the home with two rifles today and opened fire, wounding four people, authorities said. a fifth person suffered a heart attack
the gunman fled from the room at the masonic home for the aged with one rifle tied around his neck with twine, police spokesman dee anderson said. police captured him after a chase
a woman who was one of the four wounded also complained of chest pain, anderson said
a fifth person, willie joe wright, 67, suffered a heart attack and was in critical condition at arlington memorial hospital, hospital spokeswoman tenya woods said. the other shooting victims were in fair condition, she said
apparently, they had a board meeting and one former resident, who was apparently disgruntled, walked into the board room and started shooting,'' anderson said
anderson said 16 board members were in the room
when the officers went to a kitchen in the rear of the building, the man still had one rifle. he very calmly gave up when the officers asked him to surrender,'' anderson said. ``he did not give any information to police.''
the gunman, whose name was withheld, had lived at the home for three years and ``was aware of the time frame of the board meeting. he had been evicted or asked to leave,'' anderson said
the annual search for the nation's most colossal cockroach is off and scurrying
the combat great american roach-off ii came to the mcnicol middle school wednesday to kick off the contest, which will net the winner $1,000 and a trip to the smithsonian institution's insect zoo in washington to see their roach enshrined
sponsors picked the mcnicol school because last year's winner, laine snyder, who discovered his 2-inch-long entry under a hollywood beach lifeguard stand, attended the school at the time
laine has since moved, but other mcnicol students hope to make their school a winner again, even if it means changing their habits
i just step on them when i see them,'' said eric poirot, 13. ``i guess i better stop stepping on them if i want to win this contest.''
another hopeful is frank alvarez, 11, who let contest coordinator michael ``cockroach dundee'' bohdan place a hissing 3-inch monster from madagascar onto his hand
hey, no problem,'' he said. ``i handle lizards. this is just a cockroach.''
frank plans to go roach hunting as soon as he can
i'd like to get the biggest cockroaches. my mother would scream, though, when i brought it home.''
he thought a moment. ``she sure wouldn't scream if i brought home that $1,000.''
bohdan, a dallas exterminator, started the contest last year to raise awareness about roaches, which he called the most serious pest problem in the country. the makers of combat roach control system joined bohdan in sponsoring the contest
the rules: live cockroaches need not apply. they must be dead, but not squashed. those much smaller than last year's winner, which was more than 2 inches long, won't have a chance
competitions will be held in may in miami, new york, washington, los angeles, san antonio, texas, and louisville, ky. the roach-off finals will be in june in new york
roaches can also be mailed in strong packages _ some got flattened in transit last year _ to bohdan at his pest shop in plano, texas
the california supreme court today upheld the death sentences of two men but reversed a third because the defendant was not given a hearing on his competency to stand trial
the two death sentences affirmed _ one for the fatal shooting of a couple in los angeles, the other for the kidnapping and fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old girl in hayward _ marked the first time in recent years the court has upheld more than one death sentence on a single day
the three decisions were written by chief justice malcolm lucas. the court was unanimous in two of the cases, but split 5-2 in the los angeles murder. the dissenters said the judge should not have told jurors to disregard their ``personal choice'' and consider only the factors listed in the law in deciding on punishment
since last year, when conservatives led by lucas gained a majority, the court has upheld six of the 10 death sentences it has considered
in the case that was reversed, brian darle hale was convicted of fatally shooting two elderly men, robbing one and attempting to rob the other in bellflower and cerritos in october 1980
during pretrial proceedings, the court said, hale said he was ``a president'' and a better judge than the trial judge, said he had ``little speakers in his ears,'' and called the judge ``fatso,'' among other rambling statements. two court-appointed psychiatrists concluded he was incompetent to stand trial; three others disagreed
los angeles superior court judge cecil mills ordered a hearing to decide whether hale was mentally able to understand the proceedings or assist in his own defense. but for reasons not explained on the record, no such hearing was held before the trial in which hale was convicted and sentenced to death
the court voted 5-2 to uphold the death sentence of eric b. kimble for the august 1978 fatal shootings of harry and avonne margulies in the doheny estates neighborhood of los angeles, the rape of mrs. margulies and the burglary of margulies' stereo equipment store
the court unanimously affirmed the death sentence of richard hovey for the march 1978 kidnapping and fatal stabbing of 8-year-old tina salazar in hayward
thousands of people stood in driving snow thursday on the site of a triumphant rally that ushered in communism in czechoslovakia 40 years ago
banners and red flags decorated the central old town square, which in 1948 resounded with the cheers of tens of thousands when the communists took power. thursday's anniversary rally, however, was short and low-key
on feb. 21, 1948, klement gottwald gave a triumphant speech on the square four days before taking over czechoslovakia's first all-communist government
thursday's crowd was subdued. huddled under umbrellas, the number of onlookers appeared to be less than the 80,000 people estimated by the state news agency ctk. the banners hung limp in the snow
dozens of people drifted out of the square after party leader milos jakes began a 20-minute speech recalling the ``victorious february'' of 1948 and czechoslovakia's sometimes troubled history since
president gustav husak, 75, who stepped down as party leader in december, was the first member of the ruling politburo to take the stand where the leadership stood sheltered from the snow
when husak first appeared, nobody cheered or applauded. a few claps were heard in the crowd once he waved
in his speech, jakes remembered what he called ``dramatic moments deciding fateful questions of our life'' in 1948
forty years ago, a political crisis arose when most non-communist ministers in the government resigned in protest at growing communist influence in the security and police forces
five days of well-organized street rallies and fierce political discussions followed, ending with gottwald becoming head of a communist government
the takeover sealed the kremlin's domination of eastern europe, and installed a communist regime that swiftly began stalinist-style purges of opponents and of party ranks
jakes presented the 1948 takeover as a move that ensured the triumph of the working class over the ``oppression'' of bourgeois democrats who ruled in czechoslovakia before world war ii
looking back on the ``prague spring'' reforms attempted under alexander dubcek in 1968, jakes reiterated the hard line voiced in a long speech wednesday at a ceremony marking the anniversary
he again rejected any comparison between the reforms of dubcek 20 years ago and the changes said to be under way now in czechoslovakia following mikhail s. gorbachev's reforms in the soviet union
today's changes aim to strengthen socialism, jakes said. in 1968, he added, ``the revolutionary achievements of victorious february and our alliance bonds with the soviet union and other socialist states were threatened
such is the historical truth and nothing substantial can be changed in it.''
jakes gave little indication he is about to favor the economic and political reforms being tried in the soviet union, poland, hungary and bulgaria. he also ruled out all non-communist opposition
his hour-long speech to 500 party members in prague's hradcany castle did not essentially differ from the cautious conservatism husak displayed during his 18-year tenure
jakes' speech thursday was punctuated by few bursts of applause. once he finished, a loudspeaker struck up the communist anthem, ``the internationale,'' which was sung by some of the crowd and a few leaders on the stand
men in the gray-blue uniforms of the people's militia and soldiers in khaki dress uniforms marched briskly past the stand
in his public appearances recently, jakes has emulated gorbachev's style of chatting to citizens on the streets and in factories. he closed out the brief ceremony thursday with thanks to the citzens for attending and good wishes for their success at work
five minutes later, the square was deserted. television schedules had indicated the ceremony would last 75 minutes, but it was over in half an hour
the federal government's sanitation inspection program for cruise ships, now 13 years old, has made a marked difference in preventing illness among travelers, officials said thursday
the national centers for disease control, which oversees periodic inspections of cruise ships sailing regularly from u.s. ports, reported thursday that the percentage of ships passing inspection rose dramatically over the program's first decade, while the number of intestinal illness outbreaks among passengers declined
despite the positive findings, the cdc has been criticized for reorganizing its inspection program
in 1975, when the program began, cruise ships were reporting 7.7 outbreaks of diarrhea for every 10 million passenger-days sailed, said dr. vernon houk, director of the agency's center for environmental health. by 1985, the figure dropped to 2.7 outbreaks per 10 million passenger-days
a passenger-day is one day spent on a ship by one passenger. the cdc considers an outbreak in progress if 3 percent of the passengers and crew are ill
this has been a cooperative effort between us and the cruise ship industry, and ... (the study) clearly shows it has been working,'' houk said. ``things are going in the right direction.''
only 18 percent of the ships inspected in the first year earned satisfactory ratings, compared with 72 percent in 1985, cdc researchers said
the cdc also presented new findings thursday indicating ``that ships that consistently have the highest sanitation scores are less likely to have an outbreak of diarrheal disease than ships with lower average scores.''
on the average, for every 10 million passenger-days, fewer than two of the ships scoring in the top 20 percent reported diarrhea outbreaks. that compares with outbreaks aboard more than eight of the ships scoring in the bottom 20 percent
the 1975-85 results aside, critics have charged that the program's performance has suffered since a reorganization nearly two years ago. the cdc terminated its inspections in 1986, substituting a plan by which the cruise lines would conduct their own inspections. in 1987, a new plan was imposed, using private inspectors operating under cdc review
according to the cdc's latest summary of the 1987 and 1988 inspections, only 55 percent of the ships regularly sailing from u.s. ports _ 30 of 55 ships _ passed. the cdc has no legal power to block ships from sailing, but does distribute the results of its inspections
critics have said the resent inspection results are not good news for the ``privatization'' plan
thursday, houk said it is ``too early to draw conclusions'' from the initial reports from the revamped program. some ships have not yet been inspected under the new routine
houk stressed that the inspection program is thorough
travelers ought to be aware that these are very tough inspections,'' he said, ``far tougher than the usual restaurant inspections done ashore.''
the cdc inspections act as ``an independent survey'' of how well the cruise lines' own sanitation programs are working, he added
the individual traveler should not look at a single inspection report and make that the determinant whether he'll travel on that ship or not,'' he said. ``it seems to me the useful question is, `what is the past history of this ship?'''
the cdc, in its weekly report, noted that the sanitation inspections monitor water quality, food storage and preparation, potential for food contamination, cleanliness and other factors. foreign policy</head>
pulitzer prize-winning journalist seymour hersh is coming ``because you don't normally get this interesting mix of people.'' former cia director william colby will attend ``because i think someone needs to say a few good words about the agency.''
hersh and colby are among more than 30 experts and commentators who plan to meet friday at tufts university for a two-day forum on the role of covert aid and secrecy in u.s. foreign policy
the panelists include former and current members of the intelligence community, military and defense officials, journalists, educators and legal specialists. they represent opinions ``from the left, right and center of the ideological spectrum,'' forum coordinator sherman teichman said thursday
teichman said the conference, sponsored jointly by tufts, the national security archive, the u.s. department of defense and the center for the study of covert action, will address more than such obvious examples of covert action as the iran-contra affair
it is important to ask if the use of covert actions is a necessary part of dealing with foreign governments,'' he said. ``if it is a necessary evil and used to influence others to our way of thinking, then how does a democracy justify its actions?''
topics at the forum include ``the southeast asian experience: a case study''; ``lessons of vietnam and southeast asia for the 1980s''; ``the iran-contra affair: the hostage ransom, iran-israel arms sale''; and ``contra support: managing and supplying a paramilitary operation.''
also scheduled to attend are bob woodward of the washington post; ``pentagon papers'' leaker daniel ellsberg; thomas polgar, a former cia station chief in saigon; former sen. thomas f. eagleton of missouri; and scott armstrong, executive director of the national security archive
it seems like a rather contentious group of people,'' said colby, now an attorney in washington, d.c. colby said he will defend his opinion that ``covert action is a regular part of american foreign policy. it's perfectly compatible with american democracy.''
eagleton has prepared a paper reviewing the history of congressional oversight of covert activities. he said the symposium is particularly timely because of a pending senate bill that would plug loopholes in existing laws that allowed the reagan administration not to notify congress at the time of the iran arms deal
there can be a time and circumstances where covert action is clearly in the american interest,'' said eagleton. ``but the question is: under what conditions of shared knowledge does our government undertake covert action?''
hersh, with tongue slightly in cheek, said he has split views on the need for covert operations
i have mixed feelings about it because on one hand, people like me get to write books on it and make a lot of money,'' he said. ``on the other hand, i don't see, especially when you're talking about things like chile, what (secret actions) have done for the american people.'' attribution.</note>
the military council declared a state of emergency thursday and said its security forces would take ``ruthless'' action against what it called a politically inspired crime wave
producer aaron spelling and fox broadcasting co. are turning to the time-honored tradition of a nationwide talent search to find the young women who will be television's new ``charlie's angels.''
young women across the country will be offered an opportunity to land one of the four roles in ``angels '88,'' which will make its debut this summer on fox
at least five actresses discovered during the search will be assured of roles in at least one episode of ``angels '88,'' a fox spokesman said
unlike the original series, which ran on abc from 1976 to 1981, the new show will have four angels instead of three. farrah fawcett, kate jackson and jaclyn smith were the original angels, although there were cast replacements during later seasons
the dates and cities for the auditions are as follows: march 3, los angeles; march 4, chicago, boston, dallas; march 11, miami, denver, san francisco; week of march 14, open calls in 50 cities with fox stations; march 18, atlanta, detroit, nashville, tenn.; march 21, new york
finalists will take part in auditions in los angeles march 31 and the new angels will be announced april 6
the talent search is a hollywood tradition that goes back to the search for an actress to play scarlett o'hara in ``gone with the wind'' 50 years ago. at the last minute british actress vivian leigh was selected to star opposite clark gable
the disney studio is also conducting a nationwide talent hunt for youngsters who look like the original mousketeers for a movie about the ``mickey mouse club.'' admitting setting fires, details on charges; picks up 7th graf, `howe's mother ...'</note>
a former firefighter admitted setting a series of arson fires that burned a small town's elementary school and two churches that opened their doors to students, a prosecutor said today
adrian julius howe, 23, of omak will be charged with six counts of first-degree arson, prosecutor jack burchard said. he was held in the okanogan county jail
howe admitted setting the fires, which caused $6.5 million in damage, burchard said. each arson count carries a possible sentence of life imprisonment and a $50,000 fine
officials declined to comment on reports that howe held a grudge against the burned school, north omak elementary school
the six fires that began in december and hit the school twice in eight days led to the creation of a 12-member arson task force and door-to-door canvassing in search of leads. two churches and a church house were also burned; one of the churches was struck twice
howe was arrested wednesday, said mimi curry of the state department of community development's division of fire protection services, who has been appointed spokeswoman for the investigation
the task force, set up tuesday and composed of local, state and u.s. bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms agents, was ``at a peak of activity,'' with investigators going door-to-door, ms. curry said
the string of arsons terrorized omak, a placid north-central washington town of 4,000. churches and schools stepped up security, and residents formed night-time patrols
howe's mother, lena howe, 67, said she and her 75-year-old husband, ben, adopted their son at age 2. he had learning difficulties and left omak high school in his junior year, the mother told the spokesman-review in today's editions of the spokane newspaper
howe later got a job on the fire patrol in nearby nespelem, but was not rehired after he lost his driver's license because of drinking problems, mrs. howe said. he now works at a lumber mill on the colville indian reservation, just east of omak, mrs. howe said
colville indian reservation tribal chief harry smiskin said howe was a firefighter for the u.s. bureau of indian affairs' fire control department. he said he gave details of howe's employment to investigators
the washington state house voted wednesday night to include in its $207 million supplemental state budget a $150,000 appropriation to help omak and okanogan county pay for investigation of the blazes
if fully approved, the money would be used for administrative costs to complete the arson investigation, ms. curry said
the (okanogan) county budget is being quickly depleted,'' she said. ``after all, they (county commissioners) didn't plan for this (the arson fires) to happen.''
george bush took on a hot issue in a state that could be a republican indicator for the rest of the south thursday, rejecting as ``pure, all-out protectionism'' efforts backed by rivals bob dole and pat robertson to help the textile industry by limiting foreign imports
bush said he opposed legislation that has been sought by many in south carolina and other textile states as a cure for the industry's troubles. his comments came one day after dole campaigned in the same area and called for the bill's passage
i'm for the textile industry _ not the bill,'' the vice president said while greeting several hundred people alongside a greenwood street. ``there have got to be some changes before i'd be for it.''
don't go for this pure, all-out protectionism that may save one job and then throw three neighbors in this burgeoning state out of work,'' bush said earlier at a technical college in pendleton, s.c. ``that's not the answer.''
bush turned aside most questions about his long-distance exchange with pat robertson over the past two days. but he said the former tv evangelist hadn't responded to his demand for an apology or proof ``by sundown in the old south'' to back up robertson's suggestion that the release of sex-scandal allegations against evangelist jimmy swaggart had been timed to hurt robertson
haven't heard a word,'' bush said. ``i've said all i'm going to say about that.''
robertson, in louisville, ky., said he'd been misquoted and suggested bush wouldn't be asking for an aplogy if he knew what robertson had really said
bush spoke about the textile issue to several hundred teachers, students and others at an assembly at tri-county technical college, on a day when he toured the northwestern corner of south carolina by motorcade and stopped at high schools, colleges and restaurants
dole and robertson support legislation that would place limits on the amount of foreign textile products that could be imported. the legislation is popular in textile-producing areas, but president reagan vetoed similar legislation after it was passed by congress more than two years ago
what i propose is that we enforce the law,'' bush said. ``sometimes we're fighting the bureaucracy in washington. we have the laws on the books _ enforce it, so that the textile industry will continue to profit.''
at evey stop bush underscored the importance he and others attach to south carolina in the race for the republican nomination. the state holds its gop primary on saturday march 5, with 37 delegates at stake. but the state is given broader significance because it comes three days before the rest of the south votes on super tuesday, a day when one-third of the delegates in both parties will be up for grabs
robertson has said he must win in south carolina and has devoted an intensive effort. bush has long considered it one of his best states in the south, since he has broad party support including that of gov. carroll a. campbell jr., who accompanied him at his stops
bush would like a win going into the super tuesday states, after finishing far behind in south dakota and minnesota contests last tuesday, and he was spending two days campaigning here this week
dole, the kansas senator, also contesting here, was accompanied in the state on wednesday by republican sen. strom thurmond
bush dropped in on an industrial electronics class where about 30 students interrupted their final examination to hear him speak briefly and watch as he observed a demonstration of a small, computer-driven robotics machine
he sought to tie himself closely to reagan at his stops in this state where the president has been a popular vote-getter. he said, ``i've taken some shots'' for remaining loyal to reagan, ``but you and i know loyalty is a strength, not a weakness.''
major u.s. oil companies doing regular business with saudi arabia are turning to britain for protection of their tankers against iranian attacks in the persian gulf, shipping executives and diplomatic sources said thursday
the sources said the move by such corporations as chevron and mobil apparently was prompted by loss of hope that the u.s. navy's escort operations would be expanded to cover u.s.-owned or operated vessels that don't fly the american flag. the sources spoke on condition they not be identified
they said chevron and mobil recently registered five supertankers in bermuda under the red ensign, flag of the british merchant marine, and exxon corporation had brought its bahamas-registered esso atlantic out of four years' retirement to carry crude to the united states. the 516,893-ton ship is one of the world's three or four largest
exxon already has about a dozen supertankers flying the british flag, and another five sailing under the french flag
france, britain, italy and the soviet union also have naval escort contingents in the gulf
two chevron-owned vessels, the 413,158-ton chevron south america and the 264,000-ton chevron edinburgh, were shifted from liberian to bermudan registry in december. the vessels routinely operate between saudi arabia's ras tanura terminal and a chevron refinery in pascagoula, miss. the chevron fleet is estimated at 48, mainly under liberian registry
mobil, with a 28-vessel fleet, has transferred three liberian-flagged tankers to bermudan. they are the 277,000-ton mobil falcon, the 280,428-ton mobil petrol and the 138,496-ton mobil acme, which also routinely carry saudi crude to the united states
the u.s. navy's middle east force mainly protects 11 state-owned kuwaiti tankers re-registered last year in the united states. only one of the kuwaiti ships is a crude oil tanker, and none of them sails regularly to the united states, which derives only 6 percent of its oil imports directly from gulf sources
although the navy may escort any u.s.-flag vessel, few enter the waterway, where nearly 500 ships have been hit or damaged since the iraq-iran war began in september 1980 and spread to the gulf four years ago
iran strikes at neutral vessels in the 600-mile waterway in retaliation for iraqi raids on its own tanker routes
following an increase in iranian attacks last year, american shipowners with vessels registered under other ``flags of convenience'' for tax and other purposes, or carrying cargo to and from the united states under other flags, urged the pentagon to let the navy escort their vessels
the pressure increased just before the new u.s. defense secretary, frank carlucci, visited the gulf last month to reassess the navy role
however, the policy of escorting only u.s.-flagged vessels was subsequently reaffirmed, at the same time that carlucci announced a slight cutback in the number of u.s. warships in the gulf and nearby waters
the u.s. escort operations for reflagged kuwaiti tankers have been a success and the americans do not want to spoil it,'' said one of the shipping sources
the u.s. administration apparently has stressed to shipowners that protection would be given only to ships flying the american flag and therefore subject to u.s. taxes and laws requiring american crews. under united kingdom registry, vessels must have british captains but are sheltered from taxation
because britain's gulf force sails only as far north as bahrain, halfway up the gulf, ships it escorts would be on their own if heading to ras tanura, or to saudi or kuwait ports farther north
a knowledgeable shipping source in regular contact with oil companies in saudi arabia said there was ``no need for british escort beyond bahrain'' because saudi arabia's navy had made the area secure. he refused to elaborate. ^by mary sedor</byline>
israel tightened security in its capital thursday for the visit of secretary of state george p. shultz, setting up roadblocks, searching arabs' homes and rounding up scores of suspected agitators
in silwan at the foot of the mount of olives, military police in an armored vehicle searched for palestinians on foot and in cars, pulling vinyl seat cushions out of vehicles and emptying the contents of trunks onto a dirt road
at least nine people were hospitalized with beating injuries after military police sealed off the shufat refugee camp within the city limits and then broke into homes searching for arabs suspected of taking part in disturbances, hospital officials said
five palestinians were detained, according to arab reports
during the operation, an associated press photographer heard the sound of rubber bullets and several rounds of live ammunition being fired in the camp
the security crackdown, which began earlier this week, has sent hundreds of military police into arab villages incorporated into jerusalem after the 1967 middle east war
the army said 114 arabs have been detained in the last four days, including 21 minors
the police force has been doubled to 3,000 and the army was authorized to help enforce order in mostly arab east jerusalem for the first time since it was annexed by israel after 1967, the army and municipal officials said
the people in these villages for the last two months thought they belonged to palestine. we are teaching them they live in israel and they will never forget it,'' a senior police officer said. ``we are throwing the book at them: traffic violations, drug trafficking, not paying taxes.''
in al essawieh, a village of unpaved streets abutting the wealthy jewish neighborhood of french hill, riot police ran checks thursday of arabs entering or leaving and detained those whose names appeared on a computerized list
shafikh ali obeid, 57, said his son, faisal, a 33-year-old taxi driver, was held by police for 24 hours wednesday because he was on the list for not paying last year's municipal taxes
they took the keys to his car and took him away in a police van,'' obeid said. he said his son was released after he paid a $1,500 fine, part of which will be applied to pay his tax bill
obeid said the taxes did not appear to provide services to palestinians. pointing to the garbage-filled streets and a greenish stream of open sewage, he complained of the poor quality of municipal services
garbage pickup service has been stopped since january in al essawieh and other arab villages because residents stoned municipal trucks
it is a very difficult time to pay taxes because most people haven't worked since the unrest began. the israelis know that,'' obeid said
it's another way to put the squeeze on us for adhering to the commercial strike,'' he said. ``the roundups are also a message to us to keep in line during the shultz visit.''
secretary of state george p. shultz urged israel on thursday to negotiate a prompt and final agreement with the arabs about the violence-plagued occupied territories
he said the 21-year israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip was the main reason for unrest that has cost at least 65 lives since dec. 8
its fundamental origin is essentially indigenous,'' shultz said on the flight from washington to begin a five-day peace shuttle in which he will present u.s. proposals to the israelis and arabs
shultz would give no details, but said his approach to both sides will go far beyond an interim arrangement for the occupied lands, where 1.5 million palestinians live
egypt, jordan and several other arab nations have told the united states they reject the 1978 camp david formula for self-rule in the territories
president hosni mubarak of egypt called the plan, which helped produce the march 1979 peace treaty between his country and israel, ``a thing of the past whose time has ended.''
on the plane, shultz told reporters ``final status issues'' must be taken up promptly, and ``we have a proposal for that.''
it is understood to be a two-step plan that would loosen israeli controls immediately and lead to negotiations for a final settlement, even palestinian statehood, by december
the secretary said the ``underlying problem'' in the west bank and gaza is that people ``don't have the basic rights of governance.''
president reagan said at a news conference wednesday night some of the violence was inspired from outside. he cited intelligence reports but gave no details
shultz said the intelligence reports provide a ``mixed picture,'' including interaction with outside forces
in order to deal with the main problem, he said, ``we seek among other things, consistent with israel's security, to look at things that would help palestinians gain legitimate rights.''
israeli control does not lend itself to ``a stable situation'' in the west bank and gaza, he said
a ``fundamental touchstone'' of his plan are resolutions passed by the u.n. security council in 1967 and 1973 calling on israel to cede territory in exchange for acceptance by its arab neighbors, shultz said
the secretary said the u.s. package is not like a ``cafeteria,'' permitting the sides to choose elements they like and reject the others
he also rejected a soviet proposal for an international conference in which the superpowers would play an active role, contending such arrangements are not likely to produce ``good results.''
israeli foreign minister shimon peres, who had urged washington for months to be more forceful, greeted shultz at the airport and said: ``there is no better alternative than to make the first step toward the long march to bring peace to our people and our area.''
peres said israelis were in the ``most demanding period in our life.''
shultz responded: ``now is the time to work for peace and i'm convinced i'm bringing with me a workable proposal.''
the big question is what prime minister yitzhak shamir will say to shultz when they meet on friday. until now, shamir has resisted the ``territory for peace'' formula long advocated by the state department
on saturday, shultz goes to amman to see zaid rifai, jordan's prime minister, and damascus for talks with president hafez assad of syria
in the past, shultz accused syria of sponsoring terrorism and said it should be isolated. reagan imposed sanction in 1986, including a ban on meetings between high-level u.s. and syrian officials
shultz explained his decision to visit damascus by saying: ``in the first place the syrian involvement in terrorism seems to have diminished, and we have had some definite moves that have been made that we found encouraging
i don't mean to say the problem is resolved. but that was the basic problem. beyond that, as we try to find our way to something that can be helpful in the region, we recognize that syria is an important state.''
sidney poitier says he has worked hard during his 38-year-career to be considered just an actor, not a black actor
today we have eddie murphy, denzel washington, richard pryor, bill cosby and james earl jones,'' said hollywood's first black leading man
we have a lot of black actors who are working. i am now finally just another actor, and that is a hallowed place to be,'' poitier says in the sunday issue of parade magazine
during an interview on the set of ``shoot to kill,'' his latest film, poitier reminisced about his mother and his poverty-filled youth growing up in the bahamas
when a mother would be giving her son a whipping for one thing or another, she'd say, `don't do that to the boy. leave him alone and let his mind work. that's the way my young sidney was _ and look what happened to him
hearing that was one of the best rewards i ever had,'' said poitier
singer willie nelson will be principal host of the nashville network's viewers' choice awards april 26, the cable channel has announced
the oak ridge boys and tnn's ralph emery will also share hosting duties during the 90-minute live show at the grand ole opry house
tnn viewers are now voting for winners in eight country music categories
nelson is known for such hits as ``on the road again'' and ``always on my mind'' as well as his longtime commitment to helping financially plagued farmers
all eyes were on patsy kensit, lead singer of the british band eighth wonder, when she performed at this year's 38th san remo music festival
at last year's festival, a strap on ms. kensit's dress broke during her number, exposing her breast. this year, her dress stayed put
well, i see your dress didn't fall down this year,'' presenter carlo mazzarini remarked after her performance
foreign talent again dominated the four-day festival, which wraps up saturday. wednesday night's six-hour show featured manhattan transfer, bryan ferry, ben e. king, debbie gibson, def leppard and toto
still to perform were paul mccartney, terence trent d'arby, bon jovi, joe cocker and art garfunkel
ilona staller, better known as cicciolina, the porn star who was elected to pariliament last year, faced new legal problems thursday as prosecutors pressed cases to bring her to trial on obscenity charges
rome chief's prosecutor, marco boschi, announced that he has asked the chamber of deputies to lift ms. staller's parliamentary immunity so she can be tried on charges of conspiring with other people to produce obscene publications and take part in live shows
only parliament can decide whether one of its members can be brought to trial
the rome case is one of three pending against the hungarian-born ms. staller, who was elected on the radical party ticket
earlier this week, a prosecutor in venice sent parliament video tapes of ms. staller riding bare-breasted on horseback through st. mark's square last september. another case regards photos of her in a magazine
ms. staller has often said she would welcome a trial to demonstrate what she calls the hypocrisy of italy's laws defining obscenity
the head of the house space subcommittee said thursday the commerce department may be trying a ``power grab'' by granting a massachusetts company an export license for an experiment that is to be flown aboard the soviet union's mir space station
it's no secret that since space is a sexy subject that the department of commerce wants to get its fingers into the jurisdiction of space,'' rep. bill nelson, d-fla., said at a news conference
is this another power grab of trying to get into the space business?'' an angry nelson asked
nelson said he was angry that commerce granted an export license to payload systems inc. of wellesley, mass., for a protein crystal growth experiment to be carried on the mir without consulting with nasa, the transportation department or congress
the florida democrat said he was very concerned about decisions being made by u.s. agencies ``who may not understand the full implications of their decisions upon the civilian and military space programs of this country.''
he said there are a number of questions that need to be answered about the payload systems plans and added, ``i want the whole process put on hold until those questions can be answered.''
payload systems was granted a license to export an experiment to test techniques for growing protein crystals in weightlessness. such experiments have been conducted on american spacecraft in the past, including the 1986 shuttle flight taken by nelson. but the u.s. spacefleet now is grounded and the soviet spacecraft are the only manned vehicles now available to experimenters
byron k. lichtenberg, who flew on the shuttle in 1983 as a non-astronaut experimenter, founded payload systems and has designed the experiment. the firm contacted the soviets about flying it on the mir in march 1987 and then applied in october to the commerce department for an export license. the license was approved early this month
nelson said that although the commerce department consulted with some people in the defense department, it did not consult with the national aeronautics and space administration, the department of transportation _ both of which have responsibilites in space _ nor with congress
the commerce department's unilateral decision, he said, has ``ominous implications'' for the future of the u.s. space program
nelson released a letter to commerce secretary william verity in which he said the process followed for the payload systems license was ``confusing and must be clarified.'' he asked verity to appear at a subcommittee hearings on the subject, to provide information on specific questions about the license
the federal government last year refused permission for general motors and general electric to launch american-made communications satellites on soviet rockets on the basis that it could result in a technology transfer to the soviets
nelson said he fears that payload systems' protein crystal growth experiment could give technology to the soviets
i understand enough about the (crystal growth) process that i know there are questions that ought to be asked before we start giving away insights into how to do this process,'' he said. nelson said the process may have ``important military applications.''
but payload systems research director anthony p. arrott said sunday that the experiment was to investigate only protein crystals, bits of organic matter that can be used in medical and biological research
neither arrott or lichtenberg were available thursday to comment on nelson's statements. a secretary at the wellesley office said neither man was at the office and that they were not reachable by telephone
a witness instrumental in an indictment of panamanian strongman gen. manuel antonio noriega was sentenced thursday to 14 years in prison without parole for his part in a drug-smuggling, money-laundering ring
today i would like to apologize to this court and to the united states for my crimes,'' steven michael kalish told u.s. district judge w. terrell hodges in an hour-long hearing. he asked for a ``compassionate sentence,'' promising he ``would not betray that trust.''
kalish, 35, who told congressional investigators last month he personally handed noriega a briefcase containing a $300,000 payoff, previously pleaded guilty to running a continuing criminal enterprise
prosecutors agreed to a cap of 20 years on what could have been a life sentence without parole during a plea agreement struck last march in the 1984 case, said robert t. kennedy, chief of the criminal division of the tampa u.s. attorney's office. kalish agreed to forfeit $2.8 million in cash and possessions as part of the bargain
without his cooperation, the recent indictment (of noriega) would not have been possible at this time,'' the government said in a sentencing memorandum filed earlier in the week
in court, kennedy acknowledged kalish's cooperation had been substantial, but added that didn't diminish the seriousness of his crimes
hodges said he had ``no difficulty in substantially mitigating the sentence'' because of kalish's cooperation and remorse, but noted a previous conviction in texas and gave him 14 years without parole
a recommendation of where kalish would serve his sentence was suppressed by the court at the request of defense attorneys, who said their client's life was in danger
the danger is specifically that he's testified against panamanian strongma manuel noriega, who is known for having been violent in the past toward people he deems his enemies,'' kalish's attorney, alan ellis, said outside the courtroom
kalish has been in federal custody since his arrest in july 1984. he pleaded guilty to being the field supervisor of a tampa-based smuggling ring founded by leigh bruce ritch that smuggled record amounts of colombian marijuana through panama
ritch was convicted and is serving a 30-year sentence without parole
noriega, who is chief of the panamanian defense forces, and business associate enrique pretelt were indicted feb. 4 by a grand jury in tampa for allegedly taking $4 million in payoffs from kalish and ritch to protect their operation
noriega also was charged with laundering more than $100 million of the ring's profits, partly through a corporation he controlled
the same day, a grand jury in miami indicted noriega on racketeering charges accusing him of taking at least $4.6 million from colombia's medellin cartel to protect 8,800 pounds in cocaine shipments
in january, kalish told the senate permanent subcommittee on investigation that he paid noriega more than $1 million in bribes and agreed to pay $3 million more on behalf of the ring, including leaving a briefcase containing $300,000 in cash the first time he met the general
nbc is sending ``highway to heaven,'' ``a year in the life'' and ``st. elsewhere'' out to pasture and adding three hour-long dramatic series to its schedule, the network announced thursday
in the heat of the night'' will premiere as a two-hour movie march 6 and then move into the tuesday 9 p.m. time slot march 15, replacing ``hunter.''
hunter'' will move to saturday at 10 p.m., beginning march 12, replacing ``j.j. starbuck,'' which is going on hiatus and may return later
a second new dramatic series, ``aaron's way,'' premieres as a two-hour movie march 9, and will appear on subsequent wednesdays at 8 p.m. it replaces ``highway to heaven,'' which will appear at 9 p.m. on march 16, 23 and 30, and then go on hiatus
a year in the life,'' currently showing at 9 p.m. wednesday, will be seen at 10 p.m. march 9, 16 and 23. that time slot will be taken over march 30 by a returning series, ``the bronx zoo.''
the network said it also intends to adds two comedies, ``the days and nights of molly dodd'' and ``beverly hills buntz,'' to the schedule, but those times will be announced later
united airlines inc. has paid an $11,000 civil penalty to settle 1987 charges that it violated federal transportation standards involving shipments of live animals, the agriculture department said thursday
the penalty was assessed by the department in an administrative action stemming from nine shipments of dogs and monkeys in 1985 and 1986. a complaint was filed against united last year by the department's animal and plant health inspection service, which administers the animal welfare act
james w. glosser, acting administrator of the agency, said the complaints alleged that united had accepted dogs in shipping kennels that did not conform to size requirement, and that the airline ``either failed to observe and care for the dogs properly'' or stowed them in cargo space without sufficient ventiliation
two dogs died during shipment and another was killed by highway traffic after it escaped shipment, glosser said. the airline also was cited for having ``allegedly accepted a shipment of 50 monkeys in cages that were not structurally sound'' and had no markings to tell they contained wild animals, he said
other allegations included the company's failure to ``move dogs expeditiously from an animal holding area to an airplane'' and to keep shipping containers in an upright position during unloading operations
glosser said united consented to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of the act and agreed within a year to buy a training film approved by usda and show it to all employees who handle live animal cargoes
the state supreme court refused thursday to allow immediate enforcement of a new california law requiring consent of parents or a judge for an abortion by an unmarried woman under 18
the court's unanimous action apparently means the law, blocked from taking effect jan. 1 by a superior court judge's order, will remain unenforced this year while its constitutionality is challenged
major doctors' organizations and family-planning groups contend the law violates the right to privacy under the state constituion by restricting minors' ability to decide on their own whether to give birth or get an abortion
the law, sponsored by anti-abortion groups, would make it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion on an unmarried minor living at home who did not have written consent from one parent
as an alternative to parental consent, the minor could get a ruling from a judge, after a confidential hearing, that the abortion was in her best interest or that she was mature enough to make the decision on her own
state officials say about 34,000 women under 18 had abortions in 1985, the latest year for which figures are available. under the old law, which remains in effect, a woman of any age can consent to an abortion as long as her doctor concludes she understands the procedure and is consenting voluntarily
san francisco superior court judge morton colvin issued a preliminary injunction dec. 28 prohibiting enforcement of the new law until a trial could be held on its constitutionality. he said the law would cause irreparable harm if enforced in the meantime, and found a reasonable likelihood it would ultimately be ruled invalid
the state's 1st district court of appeal let colvin's order stand. attorney general john van de kamp, the lead defendant in the suit as the state's top law enforcement officer, then appealed to the state supreme court, asking the court to take over the case and to allow enforcement of the law while the suit is pending
george bush scored political points by depicting sen. bob dole as a supporter of tax hikes, but both republican presidential hopefuls have waffled on this volatile issue in the past
bush acquiesced in the notion of increasing taxes last fall though he said he didn't like it. he now maintains that he, as president, would not raise taxes
dole supported the sweeping reduction in tax rates in 1981, but helped enact a $98.3 billion tax hike a year later. he now bridles at conservative portrayals of him as willing to support tax legislation
dole said bush was ``lying about my record'' in a commercial that said dole would readily raise taxes
the ad damaged dole's chances in new hampshire. dole admitted later that he should have responded. he also evidently harmed himself by brushing aside pete du pont's debate challenge to sign a no-tax pledge
the argument revolves about the murky area of the candidates' intentions with respect to future tax increases, mostly because neither bush nor dole can cite a record of having consistently opposed such hikes
barry bosworth, a brookings institution fellow who once headed president carter's council of economic advisers, said that to the extent bush's commercial raised doubts about dole's tax intentions, voters ``responded because they vote their pocketbook.''
the dole campaign has put forth a truth squad to monitor bush's commericals during the balance of the campaign, and the bush camp continues to deny that it distorted the senator's position on taxes
but the record is full of inconsistencies regarding both general tax increases and the question of imposing an import fee on foreign oil
during the 1980 campaign, bush labeled as ``voodoo economics'' reagan's pledge to restore u.s. military might while cutting taxes and balancing the budget. but the record shows no evidence of a bush dissent from tax increases that reagan has signed in the ensuing years
in fact, the closest bush came to a dissent was when he told a crowd in iowa last november that while he didn't like the tax hikes envisioned in the deficit-reduction package, ``i'll support whatever compromise the president makes.''
bush also slipped last october by launching his presidential campaign with an uncompromising pledge to not raises taxes, only to subsequently leave the door slightly ajar. in an oct. 15 interview on cable news network, bush backtracked from his oct. 12 houston promise
what i have said is, if i were convinced that all spending that could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place, then and only then would i consider a tax increase,'' he said. later in the same day, when pressed for an explanation, bush replied, ``i'm not going to raise taxes, period.''
the record shows that dole supported various deficit-reduction tax hike proposals, including the $98.3 billion package in 1981, a $50.6 billion program in 1984 and the $22 billion in hikes contained in a plan reagan agreed to last nov. 20 in the wake of the wall street crash
but dole and his supporters complained bitterly about the bush commercials in new hamsphire _ ads which sen. warren rudman of new hampshire called a ``misstatement of (dole's) record.''
both bush and dole have made statements which seemed to indicate at least a willingness to consider an oil import fee, although dole says he voted against it five times since 1980, and bush said ``an oil import fee is not the way to decrease dependence'' on foreign oil
bush talks frequently of a need to lessen u.s. reliance on foreign oil, but discusses only generally the notion of strengthening the american petroleum industry. an oil import fee would do that
dole's spokeswoman, katie boyle, recently sought to clarify statements he made indicating he would consider such a fee, saying that it would have to carry a rebate provision for consumers
bosworth said in times of general economic prosperity, candidates for political office score big points by suggesting an opponent would raise taxes
i think dole has probably learned from this (loss in new hampshire),'' he said. ``it appears republicans voted for bush there because he appeared to be more adamant about not raising taxes than dole was.''
larry sabato, a political science professor and presidential scholar at the university of virginia, said ``this (bush) succeeded only because dole chose not to respond to it. it was very uncharacteristic of him.''
bush has no position. dole has a record, which includes revenue increases in concert with the administration,'' said bob mcintyre of the private group, citizens for tax justice
martin anderson, who served as a domestic policy adviser in the reagan white house during the first term, said ``my recollection is'' that bush was an even more ardent supporter of tax cuts than was reagan
in fact, he is pushing more, including seeking the cut in capital gains taxes,'' anderson said of the vice president
outgoing president chun doo-hwan held the hand of his 2-year-old granddaughter thursday as he left the presidential mansion after seven years in power
looking strained, chun shook hands with a long line of aides and officials in the grounds of the blue house. occasionally he flashed a tense smile as he quietly said farewell
less than an hour earlier, chun had sat in front of the national assembly and watched roh tae-woo take the oath of office as the country's new president. the two men then returned to the blue house in the center of seoul for chun's formal departure
it was the first time in south korea's turbulent 40-year history that a president had left power peacefully. officials who arranged the ceremony said it had been a problem working out what to do since there was no precedent to follow
chun, who is to serve as an honorary presidential adviser, was widely disliked for his tough rule and suppression of opposition
it is still hard to believe he is leaving. it is so quiet,'' said one man watching the departure ceremony that was nationally televised
roh watched briefly from the doorway as chun left the mansion and then went inside. chun remained outside for a few minutes shaking hands and then drove off
hundreds of security guards and officials lined sidewalks at the main gate and applauded as chun drove away. he waved back as the car sped past
life at the heavily guarded blue house quickly returned to normal after chun left. squads of soldiers resumed patrolling the mansion and its grounds
chun had said repeatedly in recent weeks that he was eager to leave office after seven taxing years. he said he had no regrets and had never wanted to be president
now is the time for me to leave the stage of history, the time to be released from the bondage of public life, the time to be free from the oppressive solitude of the executive office,'' he said in a farewell address wednesday night
chun, roh and other generals took power in 1980 following the assassination of president park chung-hee. roh was elected to succeed chun in december in the first democratic presidential vote in 16 years
some people cheered the ex-president as he returned to his home in seoul. they waved korean flags and a band of folk dancers performed a welcoming dance
other spectators complained later to newspapers that they had been ordered to take part in the ceremony. suspend agreements, sted of suspended; adds details on other threatened action.</note>
united auto workers union officials today threatened to block special agreements at six chrysler corp. plants in an effort to discourage the sale of the company's parts-making division
in addition, the union threatened to suspend other programs that call for cooperation between labor and management at plants nationwide to persuade the nation's no. 3 automaker to keep acustar inc
about 140 local union delegates and members today approved a resolution calling for the suspension of the team concept operating agreements, under which a single group of workers is assigned to put together parts of a car. the traditional american process involves one worker doing a single task on an assembly line
the union is bound by contract to honor the agreements at plants in huntsville, ala.; indianapolis; newcastle, ind.; newark, del.; trenton, n.j.; and detroit. so far, the agreements are in effect only in huntsville, indianapolis and newcastle
but the union is looking for ways to block the agreements, uaw vice president marc stepp said. he did not elaborate
chrysler chairman lee iacocca said feb. 4 that chrysler was entertaining offers to sell all or part of the $3-billion division, saying the company no longer wanted to invest in the research needed to keep some operations technologically up to date
uaw officials have said they feel cheated by talk of the sale because of concessions they made to help bring chrysler out of past financial troubles
acustar employs about 27,000 workers at more than 24 plants nationwide. it makes car parts and some non-automotive products such as chemicals and vinyl
a three-day student walkout at an academically troubled elementary school ended thursday after the principal compromised on her get-tough decision to demote 250 students to lower grade levels
parents had kept an estimated 400 students out of classes at beethoven elementary school since monday to protest the demotions of students whose reading skills were below grade level on standardized achievement tests
but they ended the boycott after principal grace dawson agreed to return demoted students to their original grade levels if their parents met individually with her and helped teachers devise reading-improvement plans
ms. dawson said thursday most of the school's 830 students were back in class and that about 150 of the demoted students had been returned to their original grade levels
but she said 100 students hadn't been reinstated. in some cases, the parents had agreed to the demotions. in others, she said, the students wouldn't be reinstated until their parents went to the school for conferences
cynthia thomas, whose 10-year-old daughter tamika had been demoted from fourth to third grade, said she thought the boycott had accomplished the parents' goal, but that the children also would benefit
they're going to get some extra tutoring and some extra reading programs for our kids.''
the principal said she ordered the mass demotions because so many of beethoven's students were several years behind in learning to read. most of them live in the nearby robert taylor homes, the nation's largest high-rise public housing project, located in a south side neighborhood rife with crime and street gangs
sometimes drastic action has to take place to break the ice,'' ms. dawson she said thursday
when the demotions took effect feb. 15, students were not shifted to other classrooms, but were taught materials and subjects from the lower grades
in some cases, entire classrooms were taught at a lower grade level, ms. dawson said
ms. dawon said the demoted students scored from two years to four years behind grade level on the iowa basic skills test given last year and on the metropolitan achievement test given in january
i will not be a party to passing students on to the next grade who aren't qualified,'' she said. ``as a professional educator, i will not sit back and say there's nothing we can do. otherwise, the children are the losers.''
the principal said her get-tough policy worked by forcing parents to become involved in their children's education
since wednesday, ms. dawson said she had met with about 60 parents to discuss the demotions. she said about 25 percent agreed to leave their children at the lower gade level for the rest of the year
i'm happy because we can't do anything to improve education without parental support,'' she added
a conservative judicial nominee told senators thursday he would discard his unorthodox views and follow supreme court precedent if confirmed, but the same liberals who opposed robert h. bork expressed doubts that he would keep the promise
in a pledge similar to that made by bork in his tumultuous confirmation hearing, nominee bernard siegan said he would ``observe the law of the land'' and added, ``i would resign'' if unable to do so
siegan, a 63-year-old professor at the university of san diego law school, is president reagan's nominee for the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals
the circuit, on which new supreme court justice anthony m. kennedy served, has jurisdiction over alaska, arizona, california, hawaii, idaho, montana, nevada, oregon, washington, guam and the northern mariana islands
siegan told the senate judiciary committee, ``there are times i will rule contrary to my own feelings. it would be a direct violation and contrary of my oath to push my position ahead of the supreme court.''
in his confirmation hearings last year, bork was unable to convince senators he would put aside his controversial writings, and he suffered a crushing defeat in the senate by a 58-42 vote
siegan's free-wheeling views do not always parallel those of bork, but he's just as controversial when writing on subjects such as civil rights, economic law, separation of church and state, and equal protection for women
as the hearing ended, people for the american way, which had opposed bork vigorously, attacked siegan in a statement
bernard siegan spent the morning distancing himself from his entire body of legal scholarship,'' the group said. but sen. orrin g. hatch, r-utah, who was one of bork's main supporters, told siegan, ``i hope people will give you a fair shake.''
siegan's testimony did not convince to bork opponents: sens. howard m. metzenbaum, d-ohio, and patrick j. leahy, d-vt
leahy questioned siegan's almost total lack of experience in federal courtrooms. ``the last time you were in federal court (35 years ago) i was 12 years old.''
metzenbaum told siegan, ``i'm concerned that if confirmed, you will find a way to implement your views. circuit courts are often the courts of last resort.'' he said there would be a ``great risk'' if the senate confirmed siegan
responding to leahy, siegan said, ``a circuit court judge is given scholarly duties to see if what the lower court did was right. i have spent 20 years of my life in scholarly activities. even a lawyer with trial experience may not know how to write an opinion.''
among siegan's controversial writings:
he would have outlawed separate but equal schools as the supreme court did in 1954, but would have used a reasoning far afield from that used by the high court in reaching its decision
according to siegan, the court should have based its decision on the right of black students to travel to the school of their choice. civil rights advocates have said travel to a new school would not guarantee pupils a seat inside
siegan wrote that the 14th amendment ``safeguards only fundamental and natural rights from violation by the states. there is no fundamental or natural right to education, nor to an integrated education. each is a political right created by government and is accordingly not within the guarantees of the 14th amendment.''
he wrote that the amendment, which extended federal constitutional safeguards to residents of the individual states, was meant to safeguard religious liberty _ but not separation of church and state
it is that view which led him to say it is ``possible to argue that prayer in school would not be in violation of the constitution.'' the supreme court has taken the opposite view
a woman accused of murdering her husband has given up her fight with his family over his burial, but she will be allowed to arrange a memorial service for him, attorneys said
denise monique horner, 21, is charged with first-degree murder in the contract shooting of her husband, vincent horner, 25, whose body was found feb. 2 in his pickup truck in a mall parking lot
mrs. horner, who is being held without bond at the duval county jail, had arranged for her husband's body to be buried or cremated by a jacksonville funeral home
but the victim's father, burt horner, filed a lawsuit saying that because mrs. horner is accused of killing her husband, she has lost her right to decide how the body should be disposed. he wanted to take his son's body to his home state of louisiana
under florida law, a dead person's spouse has the right to dispose of the body unless the spouse caused the death
circuit judge charles o. mitchell ruled that since mrs. horner has not yet been convicted of the crime, burt horner would have to prove during a civil trial that mrs. horner caused her husband's death
wednesday, however, attorneys for both sides reached a settlement in which burt horner would get custody of the body. he agreed, however, to keep his son's body in jacksonville for 10 days so mrs. horner and her family could hold a memorial service
alan chipperfield, mrs. horner's attorney, said wednesday he hopes to get a judicial order allowing mrs. horner to attend the service in the custody of an officer
prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty against mrs. horner. according to court documents, witnesses told police mrs. horner told them she had arranged to have her husband killed
there have been no other arrests in horner's death.  
a group of house members on thursday condemned south africa's decision to ban activities of anti-apartheid groups and scheduled a stepped-up timetable for action on legislation to impose stricter sanctions on the pretoria regime
several of the members also had strong criticism for president reagan, who in a wednesday night news conference said south african unrest results from ``a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy.''
rep. howard wolpe, d-mich., chairman of the house foreign affairs africa subcommittee, scheduled five days of hearings next month and said he hoped to bring a strong sanctions bill to the floor by mid-april or earlier
additional sanctions are the only peaceful means for the west to hammer home to pretoria that the west will not permit the voices of opposition to expire,'' wolpe said at a news conference
he called the white minority government's decision to outlaw even peaceful dissent ``yet one more step towards absolute totalitarian government control over south africa's non-white majority. the south african regime leaves no doubt of its determination to systematically deny any and all forms of legitimate protest, to criminalize what we in the united states know are basic human rights.''
wolpe noted that south african anglican archbishop desmond tutu had appealed to western nations to step up anti-apartheid sanctions in response to the latest crackdown, and said his committee would begin working on a tough sanctions package sponsored by rep. ron dellums, d-calif
rep. jim leach, r-iowa, criticized reagan's news-conference comment as ``very insensitive and lacking any sense of history. this is an issue of democracy. this administration has to stand up on this issue. it can't just slough it off.''
rep. william gray, d-pa., said of reagan: ``his idea of south africa is that of a 1930s tarzan movie.''
wolpe noted that the state department had protested the latest crackdown on dissent by anti-apartheid groups. but he added, ``the moment has arrived for the reagan administration to back its words with action.''
a cut in a major telephone cable 15 miles south of newark disrupted communications along the east coast on thursday, according to american telephone &amp; telegraph co. officials
bill leach, a manager in the at&amp;t network operations center, said the break occurred at about 9:40 a.m. and resulted in a ``fairly heavy network blockage'' of both voice and data transmissions
about 20 percent to 25 percent of the calls running north and south between boston and washington were answered with a recording that told callers that all circuits were busy, and asked them to try again later
a re-routing scheme whittled down the interrupted calls, and by noon all calls were going through, leach said
private circuits, most of them devoted to data transmission, would take longer to restore, leach said. loops were being arranged to divert those circuits, he said, and work was underway to repair the cable
leach said the cause of the break was unknown
the cut disrupted associated press services, interrupting dispatches from ap bureaus to the cooperative's headquarters in new york as well as news to newspapers and broadcast outlets nationwide
efforts to restore service using backup circuits were held up by the severity of the problem, but ultimately service was restored
shipments of federally inspected reindeer steaks across the country would be allowed under a proposal announced thursday by the agriculture department
there is mandatory federal inspection of cattle, hogs, chickens and turkeys at slaughter plants, which allows those carcasses to be shipped across state lines
in addition, regulations permit the voluntary inspection of certain exotic animals slaughtered for human food. those include the american bison, or buffalo, and the cattalo, a cross between cattle and the buffalo
lester m. crawford, head of the department's food safety and inspection service, said producers of exotic animals have asked that the inspection list be expanded to include reindeer, elk, deer, antelope and water buffalo
this proposal is a response to their request and could facilitate the sale and export of the carcasses, meat and meat food products from these animals,'' he said. ``once the animals and products are inspected and passed, they can be sold interstate or exported.''
producers of the animals would pay fees to receive the optional inspection service. crawford said fewer than 2,000 exotic animals are slaughtered annually at the present time and that the slaughter level is not expected to increase much if the exotic list is expanded
by comparison, he said, annual cattle slaughter has been running at more than 32 million head
public comments on the proposal can be sent by april 26 to: linda carey, fsis hearing clerk, room 3168-s, fsis, usda, washington, d.c. 20250
the federal election commission on thursday sanctioned excluding some tv costs from the state spending limits for presidential campaigns, in what a dissenting member said was ``blowing the state limits out of the water.''
by 4-2, the fec told democratic contender albert gore jr. that it is all right to count half of a television ad as a fund-raising expense _ which is exempt from the spending limits _ even if the overt money solicitation occurs during three seconds of a 60-second ad
commissioner joan aikens objected, saying it is merely ``sanctioning creative accounting to get around the limits.''
i think we are absolutely blowing the state limits out of the water,'' she said
gore, a senator from tennessee, sought the opinion after rep. richard gephardt, d-mo., and massachusetts gov. michael dukakis, who are among gore's rivals for the democratic presidential nomination, ran ads in iowa and counted up to half the cost as a fund-raising expense. that allowed them to spend more money against the iowa overall limit of $775,000
because of the need to have a good showing in iowa, scene of the first democratic caucuses, candidates try to spend as much as possible there. most of the democratic candidates spent the limit
bob bauer, gephardt's campaign attorney, expressed satisfaction with the fec decision and discounted as nonsense the allegations that the practice was merely a way to overspend
we didn't write the law. we simply read the law ... and interpreted it as the fec has interpreted it,'' he said
gore's spokesman paul risley said the campaign was glad the fec had clarified the issue, but declined to elaborate
the commission majority said the agency's auditors should not have to scrutinize every campaign commercial to decide what portion should be considered fund raising
in arguing the prevailing viewpoint, chairman thomas josefiak said that even if an ad also has other purposes, as long as it contains some obvious fund-raising message and information on how to contribute _ such as a telephone number to call _ the ad can be seen as having a dual purpose. in that case, a 50 percent allocation for fund-raising would be reasonable, the commission determined
the decision rejected the recommendation of the fec legal staff which had held that the write-off should be generally proportional to the part of the ad that contains a fund-raising message
in the case of the 60-second ad proposed by gore, with an appeal for viewers to contribute in the last three seconds, a 5 percent allocation for fund raising would be reasonable, but 50 percent would not, fec counsel larry noble contended
commissioner lee ann elliott, who dissented along with aikens, suggested a flat 10-percent write-off for fund raising should be imposed for ads. she criticized the majority decision as a ``mushy'' one that does not give the campaigns a precise guideline
the law sets a spending cap for each state and an overall campaign spending limit of $23 million, plus another $4.6 million for fund-raising costs. the fund-raising costs can be excluded from state limits as long as the campaign has not gone over the $4.6 million
the fec for several years has asked congress to do away with state-by-state limits as burdensome
gore did not mention the other campaigns in his request, but his aides said the query was an attempt to get an fec ruling on the activity of his opponents
gore's hypothetical case, involving an ad he proposed for colorado's april 4 caucuses, paralleled gephardt's commercial in iowa in which the final seconds asked viewers to ``vote, volunteer, contribute.'' gephardt excluded half the cost from the spending his campaign allocated to iowa
the gephardt and dukakis campaigns had cited the precedent of ohio democratic sen. john glenn's presidential campaign in 1984, in which the fec allowed a 50 percent fund-raising write-off for glenn's half-hour tv show
but commissioners said that example should not be a guideline, because the fec decided the matter well after the election during a routine fec audit of glenn's finances to determine if any of his federal matching funds were improperly spent or if there had been any irregularities
that decision was in the context of negotiation and compromise, josefiak noted, after the glenn campaign had initially tried to count the entire 30-minute show as a fund-raising expense
education secretary william j. bennett gave the states mediocre grades thursday on an annual report card that showed dropout rates up slightly, college entrance test scores level and spending higher than ever
the news is not what it should be. test scores are in a dead stall,'' bennett said as he unveiled two wall charts crammed with statistics ranking the states on tests, graduation rates, teacher pay and other measures
in saying that i am disappointed, i think i speak for the american people,'' bennett told reporters. ``we're paying top dollar to educate our children, but we're sure not getting top return.''
mary hatwood futrell, president of the national education association, the nation's largest teachers union, said in an interview:
the time has come to halt the wall chart charade and for people to sit down and really talk about ways we can improve the quality of education for all young people in this country.''
the chart really doesn't give us a lot of helpful information ... other than to serve as a reminder of what we said a long time ago: if you don't provide the support and the resources, and you raise standards, children are going to fall through the cracks,'' mrs. futrell said
asked if citizens should use the statistics as ammunition to vote down school levies, bennett said that depends on how well the local schools are performing
referring to chicago's troubled schools, which he said recently are in ``an educational meltdown,'' bennett said:
if i were a citizen of chicago and they said, `we need more money to make this school effective,' i'd tell them to take a hike. ... they're spending $6,000 per kid for a 50 percent dropout (rate).''
nationally, bennett said the graduation rate from public high schools in 1986 was only 71.5 percent, down from 71.7 percent in 1985
the graduation rate is up from 69.5 percent in 1982, but it is far short of president reagan's goal of a 90 percent graduation rate by 1990
only minnesota, with a 91.4 percent graduation rate, has bettered that goal. near it are connecticut, 89.8 percent; north dakota, 89.7 percent; nebraska, 88.1 percent; and iowa, 87.5 percent
the worst graduation rates are the district of columbia, 56.8 percent; florida, 62.0 percent; georgia and louisiana, both 62.7 percent; and arizona, 63.0 percent
it was the fifth straight year that an education secretary has released the controversial all charts. bennett's predecessor, t.h. bell, initiated the practice
the class of 1987's scores on the scholastic aptitude test and american college testing program were released last fall. the national average on the sat, scored on a scale of 400 to 1,600, was 906. the average on the act, which has a scale of 1 to 36, was 18.7
bennett provided his own rankings of the states
he singled out south carolina for praise, although its sat average of 832 was again dead last among the 22 states where the sat is the dominant test. he said south carolina has picked up 17 points in the past two years, and he called it a pacesetter in efforts to hold educators more accountable for student performance
bennett also praised california for a tough new social studies curriculum; virginia for efforts to make high school students take rigorous math courses; and new jersey for welcoming non-education majors into the teaching profession
the secretary said 43 states now require entering teachers to pass competency tests, up from 34 last year. they are not required by the district of columbia, alaska, iowa, north dakota, utah, vermont, wisconsin and wyoming
gordon ambach, executive director of the council of chief state school officers, said the graduation rate exceeds 75 percent if high school equivalency diplomas are counted, but he agreed that is not good enough. he cautioned against reading too much into bennett's scorecard
the wall chart listed seven states _ arkansas, georgia, kentucky, new jersey, ohio, south carolina and texas _ with laws allowing state intervention in ``academically bankrupt'' school districts
bennett said nearly 10 percent of high school graduates now take advanced college placement exams, up from less than 5 percent in 1982, and a larger proportion of seniors are taking the act and sat. that ``means we are succeeding in keeping scores level despite a larger pool of test-takers,'' he said
test results ``show that poor, black and hispanic children are performing better,'' said bennett, although there is still a wide gap between minority and majority scores
bennett said that since 1976 black students' scores on the sat have risen by 42 points to 728, while white students' scores fell eight points to 936
he was asked if it troubled him that sat scores rose during the early 1980s, but have stayed flat since he joined the cabinet
i don't take that personally.'' he replied. ``i don't think the children taking these tests are in any particular conspiracy against me. it's more a comment on what was going on in their classroom.''
movie and television writers are conducting whisper-quiet negotiations with producers for a new three-year contract, an uncharacteristic approach for the film capital's most militant union
three years ago, the 9,000-member writers guild of america shuddered under internal strife. one faction contended union leaders had misinformed the membership about the producers' offer and caused an unnecessary two-week strike
the union eventually voted to accept virtually the same contract it had rejected. an organizational shakeup followed
talks for the 1988 contract with the alliance of motion picture and television producers are nearing an end, with writers seeking a greater share of foreign market income and producers hoping to restructure residual payments for one-hour syndicated shows
the alliance is an umbrella organization representing about 200 studios and producers. the contract with writers expires at midnight feb. 29, when the producers say they will make their final offer
the union and producers have been discussing their disagreements behind closed doors, and carefully handling their public statements with low-key information campaigns
producers say that despite record box office grosses, the entertainment industry needs a serious cost-control campaign
the union seeks what it calls ``parallel growth,'' meaning more money from areas in which the producers are doing well
guild west regional director brian walton said the union is prepared to strike if necessary, ``but we would first hope to work out the problems.''
herb steinberg, a spokesman for the alliance, has characterized chief producer negotiator nicholas counter and walton as ``very intelligent, bright gentlemen ... there is no sense of rancor or confrontation.''
steinberg said the producers' offer on feb. 29 will be ``firm and final.'' walton said the union has taken precautions to make sure members are kept informed about negotiations, to avoid the confusion and rancor of 1985
since its first contract in 1947, the union has hit the bricks in 1959, 1960, 1973, 1981 and 1985 _ the most strikes by any hollywood union
its west coast members, numbering about 6,500, will vote on the producers' offer on march 1, while 2,000 of the 2,500 east coast members will consider the contract on march. 2. the other 500 members on the east coast are television newswriters unaffected by this contract
in 1987, union members enjoyed an 11.6 percent increase in residual payments, to $57 million, with $39.5 million of that from television. currently, a writer receives $5,100 for a half-hour television script, but experienced writers generally negotiate a substantially higher fee
motion pictures drew a record $4.25 billion in ticket sales for 1987. but producers insist development and production costs are still overwhelming
steinberg and walton both refused to characterize any issue as dominant. but the writers' proposal to increase their residual share of lucrative foreign market distribution income, and the producer's desire to cut residual costs for one-hour syndicated television shows, appear to be the most controversial
writers argue that theatrical and broadcasting product has become one of the largest u.s. exports, registering at least a $4.9 billion trade surplus in 1986. producers say looking at individual growth areas without paying attention to rising production costs is unrealistic
producers have asked writers to drop the fixed residual rate for hourlong television shows and accept a sliding scale of residual payments tied to the show's syndication licensing success
few shows these days turn a first-run profit. the deficit for a one-hour show in 1986-1987 was $370,274, producers have said
while shows for prime-time television have long been deficit-financed, producers used to make their money back with lucrative syndication deals for reruns. but new made-for-syndication shows have hurt that market
the one-hour show syndication market has dried up,'' alliance spokesman steinberg said. ``some deals are possible, if we could bring the price down.''
walton has said the producers' proposal is not in parity with the deal movie and television directors got last summer for accepting the same formula
the union said its analysis showed the producers' figures are derived from the 15 most expensive action-adventure shows. ``also, they are still producing and developing these hourlong shows,'' walton said
producers also want to raise the minimum for defined ``low budget'' movies and television shows. writers take a substantial cut in fees for a defined ``low budget'' work
writers once again are seeking residual increases for videocassette movies, noting directors received an increase in their 1987 contract
among the other 107 demands from the guild are increased affirmative action hiring for women and minority writers; increased health fund contributions by management; and creative rights for scriptwriters
a non-profit group on thursday announced a new loan service that will allow colleges and universities to borrow up to $100 million at below prime interest rates
the capital access trust will make loans to institutions with good credit for new buildings, renovations or for operating money
it is the latest undertaking of university support services inc., a non-profit corporation started in 1986 by business and academic leaders to lend money to students from families that do not qualify for financial aid
the rev. john p. whalen, president of university support services and former president of the catholic university of america, said more than three-quarters of the nation's campuses will need to undertake renovations or new construction in the next five years costing millions of dollars
he said the trust is ``a major new source of capital ... in amounts ranging anywhere from relatively small loans to upwards of $100 million.''
he claimed it will be able to make the loan commitments in just 45 days at rates more favorable ``than any source of borrowing we know, except tax-exempt financing.''
the trust is funded by the sale of university support services commercial paper notes, backed by a bank line of credit and underwritten by shearson lehman hutton inc
the interest rate is tied to the commercial paper note rate quoted in the wall street journal, which whalen said is significantly lower than the prime rate
whalen said that if a college borrows $50 million from the trust for three years instead of borrowing from a bank at the prime rate, it could save $250,000 to $350,000 in interest
university support services' student loan program, called consern, lends individuals from $1,500 to $25,000 a year for private school or college costs. the interest rate varies; it is currently 10.44 percent
a man and woman were charged thursday with trying to sell their 3-month-old baby girl after they allegedly offered to trade the child for a car to drive to mexico, authorities said
a car lot worker told police that the woman said she and the man wanted to trade the baby for an ``old junker'' to go to mexico because they could not afford to keep the baby
detective kevin foster said alicia rodriguez, 31, and porfirio noriega, 23, both of fort worth, were charged with the sale or purchase of a child. they were held in the tarrant county jail in lieu of $1,000 bond
a man and woman at the car dealership refused to make a trade for the child, foster said, but did offer to adopt the baby and sell the couple a car on credit
the child is in the care of the department of human services, foster said
rising floodwaters forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 people and have inundated 1,500 houses this week in the central part of the country, officials said thursday
at least 16 deaths have been reported since monday in floods along the orange river in the orange free state and have since spread to the northern cape province
rail traffic has been knocked out and the main highway between johannesburg and cape town is reduced to one lane. twenty-five magisterial districts have been declared disaster areas and farmers are harvesting their crops 24 hours a day to save something from the encroaching rivers
the strongly flowing orange river, fed by the vaal and modder rivers, has risen more than 6{ feet in two days, the south african press association reported
half of the town of douglas, 50 miles west of the historic mining town of kimberley, was underwater thursday and hundreds of residents had been evacuated to a nearby hill, sapa reported. in the towns of prieska and upington, another 200 miles west along the orange river, residents began loading furniture into trucks in preparation for the wall of water expected to hit them by saturday
local police said the flood line is already higher than the level reached in 1974, when the orange river rose more than 32{ feet, destroying 70 percent of the crops in the central part of the country and leaving hundreds homeless
the minister of national health, willie van niekerk, estimated damage to the road and rail network at about $10 million, and damage to bridges at $3 million. crop and housing damage could not be estimated until the waters subside
clean water is still scarce, telephone lines are down, and mail is being delivered by boat in areas of the orange free state
flooded roads, washed-out homes and inundated cropland have also been reported in lesotho, swaziland and mozambique, but no deaths have been reported. heroin</head>
two recently slain drug agents may have been victims of a war pitting old-line dealers and government agents against asian gangs who are importing ``golden triangle'' heroin into california, officials said thursday
emerging thai, cambodian and laotian drug rings will likely clash with existing hispanic, black and white gangs, opening the way for street wars like those in miami in the 1970s and '80s, said john hensley, the top drug enforcement officer for the u.s. customs service on the west coast
if the asians start mixing it up with the mexican and black gangs, we may see the gun battles and murders that marked the old colombian `cocaine cowboy' wars in miami a decade ago,'' hensley said. ``with the kind of money involved, either side could do the shooting.''
two drug enforcement administration working undercover to crack an alleged taiwanese heroin ring were gunned down in pasadena earlier this month. two alleged traffickers also were killed
investigators have said the alleged drug dealers were unaware they were dealing with federal agents and had set up a drug purchase with plans all along to rob and kill their ``customers.''
such violent confrontations are typical of the turf wars waged by smugglers and sellers, hensley said
in miami during the late 1970s and early 1980s, ``i was there during one turf battle between colombians and cubans and we (federal agents) were the only ones without automatic weapons,'' he said
we saw the turf wars there. if we don't get a cap on it now, it will become a reality here and we don't want it to be a reality,'' he said
the amount of golden triangle heroin, named for the fertile opium-growing area where thailand, cambodia and laos meet, arriving in california during the last two years has increased dramatically. three years ago, only about 15 percent of the heroin smuggled into the state was of the asian variety, said dea spokesman roger guevara
we now estimate that southeast asian heroin represents 50 percent to 80 percent of all the heroin coming into the country. it's a huge influx for los angeles, and it has turned los angeles into a major transshipment center for new york,'' he said
the asians, including the taiwanese, have a ready supply and the potential growth of asian gangs in heroin distribution can lead to more violence,'' guevara said. ``on the other hand, the blacks, mexicans and the whites have always controlled the street heroin market.''
it will cost some more lives to stop the war, the men agreed. agents dealing with drugs and gangs are always more at risk than other agents, hensley said
they aren't wearing body armor. undercover you never know when you're being burned and the backup isn't always that great,'' he said
heroin is more appealing to dealers than other drugs for several reasons, hensley said
because of several national programs, including big anti-drug pushes by the sports and entertainment industries and anti-drug messages by stars, use of cocaine and marijuana has stabilized, he said
heroin is different. users don't look at michael jackson as a role model. the heroin user group is growing slightly, even though there is a turnover because as new users come in, others overdose and die out.''
and heroin brings a distributor a much higher price than a like amount of cocaine, hensley added, in part because it ultimately can be diluted to as low as 3 percent for street sales
a pound of heroin sells for about $50,000, and a kilo, 2.2 pounds, for between $90,000 and $200,000, ``depending on the purity and the dealer,'' he said
agents used to concentrate on couriers who brought in a few pounds of heroin on ships or international flights, he said
but now, heroin has started arriving in the mail, hensley said. ``about two weeks ago, we seized about 45 pounds at the mail facility in oakland.''
we have to look everywhere now,'' he said
the environmental protection agency on thursday unveiled a draft policy that could let states decide when, where and how to use pesticides which could contaminate groundwater
states would get such powers by adopting pesticide management programs approved by epa. otherwise, epa would forbid use of the pesticide in states or counties with high potential for groundwater contamination
without a state plan, ``the risk-benefit determinations underlying these epa-determined geographic prohibitions will be rather crude,'' the agency said
with a plan, states could employ more detailed land and water data than epa would have available. ``where found appropriate, epa would consider modifying the federal registration to accomodate the state program,'' the agency said
epa published the policy as a draft, asking for comment from the public over the next four months
a single national approach ``is going to over-protect, or possibly under-protect'' in specific areas, said john a. moore, assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, at a news conference
soils and groundwater vulnerability vary greatly even within counties, and at the county level and below ``epa's ability to do something ... is not very good,'' moore said
but that does not mean ``epa would walk away from these pesticides.'' in deciding whether to license a chemical, or re-license it, epa has been considering groundwater in deciding whether to impose national conditions, he said
also, the contamination standards the states would be obliged to observe would be set by epa _ existing drinking water standards for chemicals that don't cause cancer, and for cancer-causing chemicals, a concentration that would yield a one in a million chance of cancer for someone drinking from the aquifer over a lifetime
pesticide contamination of groundwater is a relatively new issue. the first examples were found in new york and california in 1979
epa expects to complete a survey in 1990 on the extent of contamination. two years ago, the agency said 19 pesticides had been found in groundwater in 24 states. now, said patrick holden, team leader of the groundwater project in epa's pesticides office, 50 to 60 different chemicals have been found in wells in 30 states. iowa has found pesticides in half the wells serving cities
pesticides are not the only thing that contaminates groundwater, source of drinking water for half the population and for 97 percent of people living in rural areas. fertilizers, waste disposal wells and leaking underground tanks all can contribute substantially
states may get federal aid for setting up wellhead protection zones, and soon epa expects to adopt a groundwater strategy that would require states to classify aquifers under a three-part scheme for high priority protection, drinking water sources and water unlikely ever to be drunk and thus needing little protection
this strategy has been opposed by many environmentalists as writing off what could a substantial fraction of groundwater supplies
sen. david durenberger, r-minn., said thursday in introducing a bill calling for minimum federal standards for all aquifers, ``i cannot agree with it.''
we have no right to come in on this slice of the world or life in 1988 and say we are just going to abandon these resources,'' the senator told a news conference about his bill, at least the 10th dealing with groundwater this session
the senator said he would have to study epa's thursday proposal for the states, though his bill would permit states to go beyond federal standards
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis called rival richard gephardt a ``flip-flopper'' as tensions ran high between the two at a long-term health care forum on thursday
dukakis warned gephardt against turning the campaign negative, but gephardt said he thought it was important to highlight differences on issues and experience
dukakis and gephardt are struggling for stature as the calendar winds down toward the super tuesday round of primaries and caucuses in the south. each has won two contests to date
earlier in the day, dukakis said he learned a painful lesson about negative campaigning when he lost a 1978 re-election bid as massachusetts governor and ``it's not going to happen again.''
he went on to say in boca raton, ``i don't think this `prince of darkness' routine is going to sell'' and that he would not stand for gephardt attacks
in the hour-long health care session here, dukakis and gephardt largely agreed on the need for a national long-term health care program. but dukakis bristled when a question suggested he was flip-flopping on the role of private insurance for long-term care
this is the flip-flopper over here; i'm not the flip-flopper,'' dukakis said, looking at the missouri congressman, whose record has been criticized by other candidates as inconsistent
both strongly supported the proposal by rep. claude pepper, the 87-year-old miami democrat, to guarantee home health care for the elderly and chronically ill. pepper's bill didn't come to a vote last year as some congressional democrats worried about a potential cost in the tens of billions of dollars
pepper's plan would lift the 45 percent cap on income subject to medicare payroll tax, and both candidates agreed that extra revenue should be able to get the program started
it's the old-fashioned american way of taxing on the ability to pay, which is what we ought to do,'' dukakis said
we're not doing it right today,'' gephardt said of government-provided health care. ``it doesn't have to cost a lot more money.''
dukakis said health care presents a fundamental difference between the democratic and republican parties and he called health care an american birthright
if you lose your health, nothing else matters,'' gephardt said to loud applause from the audience at a retirement community
dukakis said he dominated gephardt in working-class areas of new hampshire and minnesota, both contests the massachusetts governor won, then warned that a negative campaign would hurt the democrats and also that gephardt's record was vulnerable
people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,'' dukakis said after the senior forum here. he said gephardt shouldn't attack the establishment and then accept corporate political action committee funds
something could be said for consistency,'' dukakis said
gephardt denied his campaign was negative
i am trying in this campaign and will continue to try to outline what i think are the differences,'' gephardt said. ``let's have a discussion of the issues.''
dukakis scoffed when told gephardt said he wasn't being negative
everybody knows what he's doing. when you're behind you attack,'' dukakis said
on wednesday, gephardt gave a speech in waco, texas, that harshly criticized dukakis. ``the candidate with the most money has the least message,'' gephardt said
mcdonald's has decided the british spud is a dud when it comes to french fries, and its plan to switch to american potato varieties has created a flap among some patriots
the fast-food chain plans to use british-grown potatoes of the north american variety called the russet burbank. for years, it has used british-grown potatoes of the british pentland dell variety
a company spokeswoman said thursday the decision to make the change in the british mcdonald's outlets was made ``basically because the russet burbank has got a better flavor and texture.''
it is a more suitable potato for our requirements,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with british custom
she said british farmers have been contracted to grow the american variety
mcdonald's is a big customer of the british potato farmer. it needs 55,000 tons of potatoes a year to keep its 263 british outlets in the chips, as the french fry is called here
the american variety produces french fries that hang tantalizingly over the edge of their packets without breaking in the middle, farmers told the today newspaper
but agricultural expert michael shaw, who isn't happy about the switch, told the newspaper, ``mcdonald's is so powerful in the fast-food business that they are killing off the great british chip.''
conservative lawmaker ann winterton agreed
my primary interest is promoting food which is grown in this country. potatoes is a crop we grow particularly well. there are many varieties of excellent qualities.''
she said it would suprise her if the american variety was better
another tory member of parliament, jerry wiggin, chairman of the house of commons select committee on agriculture, said: ``judging from the fantastic support from my own children, mcdonald's doesn't appear to be doing badly using british potatoes.''
mcdonald's conducted tests with the russet burbank on farms throughout the country during the past eight years, according to the daily telegraph
this year, production of the russet burbank, which was developed in california 112 years ago, is in full swing on about 4,000 acres, the daily telegraph said
britain's potato marketing board is not opposed to the switch
the amount of potatoes being taken up on the processing side is increasing and obviously, if growers want to take advantage of it, obviously they have to grow what the buyers want,'' said a board spokeswoman, who didn't want to be identified further
there is not going to be an en masse switch to russet burbank with everyone growing nothing but that,'' the spokeswoman said
mcdonald's main rivals say they are sticking with their british spuds
john shedden, a spokesman for burger king, said the british variety meets all of burger king's requirements. burger king has 18 outlets in britain
wimpy, a british fast-food chain, operates 400 restaurants that fry about 8,580 tons of potatoes a year. it uses the british pentland dell variety, as well as another british variety called the maris piper and a dutch variety called bintje
a wimpy spokeswoman said the type of potato used has less to do with the chips' flavor than the fat or oil used to fry it
wimpy says its uses vegetable oil. mcdonald's says it uses a combination of cottonseed oil and beef tallow. burger king won't say
polish authorities are blocking solidarity leader lech walesa and three top aides from traveling to australia to attend an international trade union congress, a spokesman for the banned union said wednesday
the authorities are trying to block the procedure at every possible stage,'' said solidarity's national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz, in a telephone interview. ``they are trying to play formal, bureaucratic tricks ... without actually refusing to grant them passports.''
walesa and three other solidarity leaders are trying to obtain passports to allow them to travel to australia to attend the march 14-18 world congress of the international confederation of free trade unions in melbourne
they were invited by the australian confederation of trade unions
lech wants to do everything possible to go there, as this is a congress of a trade union organization of which solidarity is a member,'' said bogdan olszewski, a walesa aide, contacted at the union leader's gdansk apartment
walesa has not left poland since the december 1981 imposition of martial law that suppressed solidarity
walesa applied 10 days ago for vacation leave from his job as an electrician at gdansk's lenin shipyard, but so far he has not received any response from shipyard authorities, olszewski said
poles must have the approval of their workplace in order to file an application for a passport, which then can take two to four weeks to be processed
walesa expected the shipyard would delay its decision until it was too late for him to make the trip, olszewski said. walesa once earlier tried to obtain a passport to travel to italy, but was refused leave from the shipyard
wladyslaw frasyniuk, the wroclaw solidarity leader, said the local passport office refused to accept his passport application on thursday, claiming his invitation was invalid because it was not issued by a private individual but an institution
bogdan lis, the gdansk solidarity leader, said he would try to apply for his passport friday, while union adviser bronislaw geremek of warsaw has filed his passport application and is waiting for a decision
polish government spokesman jerzy urban told a news conference tuesday that if walesa is granted a leave from work his request for a passport ''will be examined in accordance with the existing regulations, as is the case with every other polish citizen
a secret presidential study harshly criticizes state department officials, the american ambassador and marines for neglecting security at the u.s. embassy in moscow where a sex-for-secrets scandal erupted last year
a fundamental reorientation of the way we do business in the soviet union is critical,'' according to the report by a blue-ribbon panel that president reagan appointed last spring
the report scores the ambassador for his ``aloof'' management style, calls working conditions at the embassy a ``national disgrace,'' and says marine guards ``tolerated'' and then ``covered up'' incidents of misconduct, including sexual activities, drunkenness, brawling and currency manipulation
many share responsibility for the security vulnerabilities that existed and in some cases still exist,'' said the panel, headed by former defense secretary melvin r. laird
the so-called laird report was submitted to the state department, which has refused to release it. charles redman, a department spokesman, said the report has not been made public because it is a confidential document for secretary of state george p. shultz
laird urged release of an unclassified version of the document, but said he could not talk about its substance unless the department unseals it. there is also a classified version of the report containing more sensitive information
the associated press was shown a copy of the report, the result of the panel's work from may 7 until july 17
since the panel finished work, one marine has been convicted of spying. but some of the more sensational allegations _ such as reports that kgb agents were allowed to prowl the embassy's top-secret areas _ have been discounted
the report said what happened at the embassy ``may never be known,'' and it added: ``our investigation has revealed that a situation existed ... that would have permitted the incidents to have occurred as alleged...''
robert e. lamb, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, said gaps existed in the embassy's security program in the past. ``there were some holes and we have moved to fill them,'' he said
efforts have been made to upgrade security and add more personnel to the counterintelligence staff, he said
some of the findings in the laird report are new; others repeat concerns raised previously about the embassy. here is a sampling:
_laird called the embassy a ``pigsty,'' and the report said it was a fire trap. last week, fire broke out in a section of the embassy
corridors were cluttered with papers, books and personal effects; stairwells and hallways were ``strewn with broken equipment and machinery parts awaiting repair and disposal,'' the report said
those assigned to moscow find themselves working in a seedy, disgraceful facility with inadequate support from washington,'' the report said
_it is ``possible that some marines who had discipline problems elsewhere were assigned to moscow as punishment,'' and the situation was ripe for exploitation by the kgb, the soviet spy agency
_the panel reserved ``special criticism'' for the marines in the guard detachment as ``their misconduct and failure to perform their duties in a prescribed manner led to increased vulnerability in the mission's security,'' the report said. some embassy staffers also violated regulations
_confusion marked policies barring marines from fraternizing with soviets and reporting their contacts. the policies ``obviously were not taken seriously enough to provide security,'' the report said
_the state department's counterintelligence staff was so overworked _ only 11 of the 27 authorized positions were filled _ that ``only the most rudimentary investigation was conducted on the most pressing cases.''
the gross neglect of the state department's counterintelligence may be germane to the alleged security breaches in moscow,'' the report said
_some of the soviet citizens working at the embassy were ``known to be kgb operatives,'' and were ``accorded far too much access to americans.''
the americans had ``ambivalent and contradictory'' attitudes towards the soviets, who worked in a variety of administrative, clerical and support jobs such as cooks, drivers and baby-sitters. the soviets removed their nationals from the embassy in october 1986
_the ambassador ``employed a management style that remained aloof until a specific event occurred and required his attention. ... this was clearly inadequate.''
arthur a. hartman, the u.s. ambassador in moscow from 1981 until 1987, did not return telephone calls placed to his house and his office. he has maintained that earlier reports about the embassy's security problems were overblown
sgt. clayton j. lonetree, an embassy guard in 1985 and 1986, was convicted of espionage for giving the kgb the identities of cia agents and the floor plans to the u.s. embassies in moscow and vienna
but government prosecutors dropped charges against lonetree and cpl. arnold bracy that they permitted kgb agents to roam the embassy. another marine was convicted of dereliction of duty
the naval investigative service says eight other espionage-related cases involving marines remain open as a result of polygraph tests administered after lonetree's confession
besides laird, the panel included richard m. helms, a former cia director; gen. john w. vessey jr., former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; and diego c. asencio, former ambassador to brazil
also thursday, the office of rep. dan mica, d-fla., made available copies of a preliminary general accounting office inquiry into reports of espionage by marines. mica had disclosed details of the report last week
among others things, the gao _ the congressional watchdog agency _ said ``coordination and cooperation'' between the state department, the marines and the naval investigative service was ``less than adequate.''

the value of u.s. agriculture exports is expected to rise to a four-year high of $32.5 billion this fiscal year, the agriculture department said thursday
spurred by recent heavy sales of grain to the soviet union and china, partly under a special export subsidy program, the new 1988 forecast is up $500 million from $32 billion indicated on dec. 17
the new export forecast came just as the department announced another cash sale of corn to the soviet union, the second in two days
overall, with a shipment value of $32 billion, exports in the fiscal year that began oct. 1 would be up 16 percent from $27.9 billion in 1987 and up 24 percent from a decade low of $26.3 billion in 1986. agricultural export were valued at $31.2 billion in fiscal 1985 and $38 billion in 1984
most of the increase (from the earlier estimate) stems from additional wheat sales under the export enhancement program ,'' usda said. ``since the december forecast, eep offers were announced for 2 million metric tons of wheat to the soviet union and 1.2 million tons to china, among others.''
under the eep arrangement, private exporters get free surplus commodities from the agriculture department as subsidies so they can sell grain and other products overseas at reduced prices
on the basis of actual volume, 1988 exports were indicated at 142.5 million metric tons, up from 141 million forecast in december and 129.2 million tons shipped last year
the u.s. share of the world market, particularly in grains and cotton, is rising,'' officials said in their report. ``relatively low world prices and improved u.s. competitiveness through lower (price support) loan rates, the eep and a lower dollar have reduced production incentives for foreign competitors.''
meanwhile, private exporters reported the sales of 601,600 tons of corn for delivery to the soviet union this year under a long-term supply agreement between the two countries
on wednesday, the soviets bought 350,000 tons of corn, the first substantial amount since last october. corn sales are not qualified for eep subsidies, however
no selling prices or other information about the corn sale were disclosed. when subsidies are involved, the exporting firms, quantities and amounts of eep payments are shown, but not when straight cash deals are involved
a metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. the 601,600 tons of corn would be about 24 million bushels, having a farm value of around $44 million at recent prices of about $1.82 per bushel
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of u.s. grain. the pact expires sept. 30
according to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent
with the latest purchases, the soviets now have bought more than 2.6 million tons of corn, or two-thirds of the minimum of 4 million tons specified by the agreement
by comparison, the soviet union has bought more than 6.3 million tons of wheat at subsidized prices, plus 800,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal for delivery this year
military medical officials said thursday that improvements are needed in battlefield health care but conditions have improved greatly since five years ago, when only one out of 10 casualties could expect adequate care
we have to spend either dollars or blood, and we prefer to spend dollars,'' navy surgeon general james a. zimble told a house armed services subcommittee hearing
zimble said congressional support will be needed for a plan to attain wartime medical readiness by 1992
dr. william mayer, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said that five years ago adequate medical attention would have been available to only 10 percent of battlefield casualties. after a year, improvements increased that figure to about 20 percent, mayer said, describing condition as ``still grossly unacceptable.''
he said no comparable figures are available for present conditions but more facilities are still needed abroad. he said there is no funding for 41 overseas army hospitals, in addition to three for the navy and two for the air force
mayer said the u.s. military can now mobilize about 60 percent of the medical personnel and facilities needed in the event of ``general war.''
i'm very comfortable that we're most of the way toward being able to respond adequately today in ways that we couldn't have dreamed of five years ago,'' he told the subcommittee on medical personnel and compensation which is examining military medical care readiness abroad. the panel has scheduled a similar hearing on domestic military medical facilities for march 8
mayer said there is a danger that if improvements in health care for the armed forces do not continue, it could become ``a national scandal.''
air force surgeon general murphy a. chesney said he has purchased 75 percent of the hospital beds that would be needed overseas in wartime but there is no money to obtain the other 25 percent
he said that with the growth of soviet offensive capabilities, u.s. air force bases have to be considered ``first-strike targets.'' he said in 1979 it was concluded that potential casualty rates at air bases were 17 times those previously predicted
since then, he said, the value of medical facilities has grown from $17 million in 1978 to an expected $450 million when all funded work is completed. but that still leaves the air force needing 10 more hospitals with 500 beds each, he said
army surgeon general quinn h. becker said, ``although we have achieved admirable progress in correcting our medical readiness shortfalls, critical equipment and personnel deficiences remain.''
a student was shot in the head and critically wounded by another male student thursday in a courtyard of bristol high school, police and hospital officials said
according to witnesses, the victim was shot while pulling off his jacket to fight with the other student, said mike slocum, a senior at the school
the two youths had been fighting for weeks, said kate meyer, a freshman
the 15-year-old was in critical condition with a single gunshot wound in the head and was taken into surgery at rhode island hospital, said spokesman rick piester
police detective richard almeida said the shooting took place in a school courtyard shortly after noon. authorities reportedly had at least one suspect in custody and have recovered a small-caliber handgun
neither almeida nor superintendent gerald p. bourgeois could furnish the identities of either the shooting victim or suspect
slocum said about 30 people were in the courtyard when the shooting occurred
several students interviewed said they did not witness the shooting but saw the victim sprawled on the floor seconds later
gloria meola, a freshman, described herself as a close friend of the victim. ``i saw him lying on the floor ... all that blood,'' she said, wincing. ``i saw him on that floor, and i freaked out.''
meola said the suspect ran into the school and, with the help of another student, escaped through a window
slocum and several other students described the shooting suspect as a student who was frequently teased. ``the truth is, he was a geek,'' he said
meola said that after the shooting principal edward l. jawor told students over the intercom not to talk to reporters, ``like we're going to act like it's a normal day and our close friend just got shot in the head.'' built</head>
television evangelist jimmy swaggart's admission of moral failure isn't expected to hinder development of a $2 million canadian headquarters, says his representative in canada
the rev. norman maclaren, who has headed swaggart's canadian operation since 1983, said he was planning a new building for his 200-member congregation in niagara falls 10 months ago and decided to make it large enough to serve also as the canadian headquarters for jimmy swaggart ministries
a foundation has been laid for the building, which will include a 1,300-seat sanctuary. the building is expected to be finished by nov. 30
maclaren said his church is a member of the pentecostal assemblies of canada, which is affiliated with the assemblies of god denomination of which swaggart is a member
asked if the tv evangelist's temporary absence from the pulpit and othe4r disciplinary action by the denomination will affect the local plans, maclaren said ``we trust it won't.''
between 35,000 and 40,000 canadians subscribe to swaggart's evangelical magazine, he said. this is the group that will be served by the headquarters in niagara falls
being the swaggart headquarters means handling all canadian distribution of the evangelist's music, tv tapes and literature and processing all incoming mail, maclaren said
hundreds of bruce springsteen fans lined up thursday outside the worcester centrum arena vainly seeking tickets for the sold-out opening concert of the boss' nationwide ``tunnel of love'' tour
we do have have some people outside who are not believing us,'' said centrum marketing director kathleen heinz. ``they think they will be more tickets. we're telling them that's not the case. the tickets are all sold.''
more than 13,000 fans held tickets for the thursday night concert
during an appearance wednesday in boston, springsteen promised ``plenty of surprises'' in the three sold-out dates at the arena
worcester police deputy chief edward o'brien said 30 officers were stationed at the centrum for crowd control and to hunt down ticket scalpers, who reportedly were reaping up to $600 a ticket
a 23-year-old worcester man was arrested after he allegedly sold two $20 tickets to a plainclothes police officer for $400. police seized four tickets to thursday's show and two for the final worcester show on monday, and the man was fined $525 for reselling tickets and selling tickets without a license
and in case anyone was wondering, worcester cobbler david jennette says springsteen wears a size 10d boot
i didn't believe it when we got the call tuesday night asking if we'd do some work on bruce springsteen's boots. i thought it was a prank,'' jennette said. ``we were just closing up so i said `ok, come right over,' thinking it was some kid calling up.''
it was no joke. a few minutes later, springsteen's road manager appeared with a pair of boots and asked to have the leather soles replaced with non-skid rubber soles
jennette was invited to springsteen's rehearsal and took his sister-in-law along
bruce was great. after the rehearsal he came over and talked to us and let us take pictures with him,'' he said
singer wayne newton, who made a bigger hit in las vegas than president reagan did, came to the white house on thursday to get an award from reagan for entertaining members of the armed services
newton, one of the biggest draws in the nevada entertainment capital, showed up in the lead car of a caravan of three stretch limousines to collect a plaque for his tours on behalf of the united service organizations
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said newton gave a thanksgiving tour aboard ships in the mediterranean and has also toured the arabian sea and the persian gulf
we talked about his las vegas years,'' newton said of his conversation with the president. ``i didn't sing for him and he didn't sing for me, and i think we'll probably keep it that way.''
reagan worked briefly as a night club master of ceremonies in las vegas after his movie career faltered and before he entered politics
a grand jury may investigate possible criminal wrongdoing stemming from a black fbi agent's claims that he was the victim of racial harassment by fellow agents, a government lawyer said thursday
justice department attorney david m. glass told the judge who is hearing a civil lawsuit brought by fbi special agent donald rochon that the department was conducting a criminal investigation of the case
there has been some consideration of criminal proceedings,'' glass told u.s. district judge charles r. richey
glass made the statement in response to the plaintiff's request to examine fbi documents and investigative files to prepare for the case for trial
glass contended that opening the files to rochon's lawyers could interfere with the investigation being conducted by the criminal division of the justice department's civil rights division
rochon, 37, charged in the lawsuit filed last fall that fellow agents in omaha and later chicago waged a three-year campaign of harassment that included a letter threatening death, mutilation and sexual assault of his white wife
an fbi agent was suspended for two weeks for forging rochon's name on an application for an insurance policy covering his death or dismemberment and another for burial benefits, according to the lawsuit
a department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators are examining letters containing threats to obtain corroboration of rochon's charges
the letters are being examined to determine if the mails were illegally used to harass rochon, the source said
rochon also claims the fbi retaliated against him for complaining by transferring him to chicago and placing a letter of censure in his personnel file. the lawsuit also charges that fbi officials deliberately ignored his allegations to suppress them
on his first day on the job in chicago, rochon says agents placed chocolate in the earpiece of his telephone so that it would come off on his ear when he used the instrument
during a four-day period in the spring of 1985, rochon says he received a letter threatening him with violence, mutilation and death as well as sexual assault of his wife, susan. the letter contained a picture of a mutilated black man, the complaint says
four days later, rochon received a bill for an insurance policy for death and dismemberment that had been taken out in his name
the lawsuit states that fbi officials in chicago gave agent gary miller a 14-day suspension after determining that he had forged rochon's signature on the insurance application and on another for death and burial benefits
but the fbi did not report miller's actions to prosecutors ``although he clearly violated federal and state criminal laws,'' the lawsuit said
the lawsuit charges that in 1986, the justice department's civil rights division deliberately shut down the equal employment opportunity commission's investigation of allegations of harassment in chicago, saying it was conducting a criminal investigation
rochon's lawsuit charges that even though the justice department notified the eeoc of the criminal investigation, it did not interview rochon or agents suspected of wrongdoing until last summer
last summer the eeoc ruled that rochon was unfairly disciplined in omaha and transferred to chicago. the eeoc ordered the fbi to allow rochon to be transferred to any office of his choice within the agency
eeoc also ordered the fbi to lift the 1984 letter of censure, which rebuked rochon for failing to report that he was the victim of possible housing discrimination
the eeoc examiner determined that rochon was the only fbi special agent ever censured for failing to report a legal violation of which he was the victim
the eeoc also ordered fbi training sessions for the agents involved in the racial harassment to ensure such conduct would not be repeated
during the hearing, the judge urged the justice department to find a way to settle the lawsuit to avoid lengthy court proceedings. say</head>
authorities have seized the home of a 90-year-old woman and evicted a family they say terrorized and beat her and stole thousands of dollars from her over the past few years
the retired teacher, whom authorities declined to identify, has cancer and was taken to a nursing home several days before police moved in. she has not been told about the raid and eviction, officials said
eight district attorney's investigators, two police lab technicians and two patrolmen raided the house tuesday night after relatives became alarmed and called authorities
they evicted the live-in housekeeper and her son and daughter-in-law
we have evidence at this point of emotional, verbal and physical abuse _ things that really make you angry to hear about,'' said dave heckenbach, chief deputy district attorney
like smacking her when she doesn't move fast enough, pushing her down when she doesn't drink her fluids fast enough, bruises on her body, bumps on her head, yelling at her, screaming at her, threatening her,'' he said
no charges had been filed as of thursday
we recovered numerous documents that we will have to go through before charges can be filed,'' said diane balkin of the district attorney's office
the woman's troubles began in early 1985 when she advertised for a live-in housekeeper and hired lois hicks, 62, authorities said
ms. hicks took control of the woman's finances and ``substantially depleted her money,'' said heckenbach
we don't know the totals yet,'' heckenbach said, but financial documents were seized when the house was raided. he said that just two bank withdrawal slips that he saw showed withdrawals from the woman's account of $15,000 and $22,000
and they seized many more than what i saw,'' he said. ``i can say easily that we are into the many tens of thousands of dollars that these people took from this lady.''
two years ago, officials said, ms. hicks' son, john hicks, 34, and his wife, cheryl hicks, 35, moved into the house with their eight cats, a dog and a ferret
heckenbach said both john hicks and his wife are ex-convicts. cheryl hicks was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and murder in georgia, and john hicks was convicted of aggravated robbery in georgia, he said. the two met in a halfway house and had been out of prison a short time when they moved into the elderly woman's home, said heckenbach
the family hired their own housekeeper and bought three cars, said heckenbach
heckenbach said that last october, lois hicks told the teacher's lawyer that the elderly woman wanted to change her will
the attorney, to his credit, refused to change the will because his assessment was that she was not mentally able to make a voluntary decision at that point,'' he said
he also told us he saw fear in her eyes and terror in her eyes,'' heckenbach said. ``it was his distinct impression she was being intimidated by lois hicks.''
john hicks was out of town, but lois and cheryl hicks were at the house when officials seized it. they were allowed to take some clothing and toiletries before they were locked out, officials said
barbara cook will not appear in ``carrie,'' a musical version of the stephen king novel, when it arrives on broadway in april, a spokesman for the show said thursday
miss cook, who was the original marian the librarian in ``the music man,'' will withdraw from the show after it completes its pre-broadway run in stratford, england, on march 5, said the show's spokesman jim baldassare
in the musical, miss cook plays carrie's mother. the title character, a teen-age girl with telekinetic powers, is played by a 17-year-old english actress named linzi hateley
miss cook's decision to leave the show was based on consultations between the actress, director terry hands and producer friedrich kurz, baldassare said. several performers are under consideration to replace miss cook but no offer has been made, the spokesman said. the show was to have been miss cook's first appearance in a broadway musical in 17 years. her one-woman show had a short run on broadway last spring
carrie,'' which also was turned into a brian de palma movie starring sissy spacek, has music by michael gore and lyrics by dean pitchford
the show is scheduled to begin preview performances at the virginia theater on april 12 and open on may 1
two common antibiotics used against traveler's diarrhea helped a group of aids patients live longer by preventing the pneumonia that is a leading cause of death from the disease, a study found
the drug therapy gives doctors an important new weapon in the fight against aids, a fatal, incurable immune disorder, one of the study's authors said thursday
if we intercede early with medications that may prevent life-threatening infections, that will prolong life and improve the quality of life,'' said dr. margaret fischl, lead researcher on the study published in friday's journal of the american medical association
the two antibiotics, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prevented 30 patients with early stages of aids from developing pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while they remained on the drugs
the patients also lived much longer than 30 similar patients who did not receive the drugs, said ms. fischl, an associate medical professor and director of aids research at the university of miami school of medicine
the patients each had been newly diagnosed as having kaposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer that afflicts aids patients. but they hadn't developed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or any of the other opportunistic infections that eventually kill aids victims, the study said
more than 50 percent of patients with aids develop pneumocystis carinii infection and, despite therapy, more than 20 percent die with overwhelming infection,'' the study noted
aids, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving its victims prey to infections and certain cancers
the patients were studied between january 1984 and june 1985, and were re-examined in june 1987
sixteen of the 30 patients who didn't receive the antibiotics developed the pneumonia, the study results showed
none of the 30 patients taking the antibiotics developed the pneumonia while they received the drugs, the study said
but half of those receiving the drugs had side effects such as nausea and skin rashes, the study said. five had such severe reactions they had to stop taking the antibiotics, it said. four of the five developed the pneumonia within four or five months after the treatment was halted
during the study, 28 of the 30 patients _ 93 percent _ not receiving the antibiotics died, compared with 18 patients, or 60 percent, in the group that took the drugs
ms. fischl estimated that 40 percent of the patients who took the drugs remain alive today. only one patient who wasn't given the drugs is still living, she said by telephone from her miami office
a study published in the new england journal of medicine in 1982 found that the same two prescription antibiotics were effective in quickly relieving the misery of travelers' diarrhea, a disorder common to visitors of latin america, the middle east, the far east and the mediterranean
ms. fischl recommended thursday that all patients with aids and aids-related illness, a condition called arc, be considered for therapy with the two antibotics
similar tests are being conducted on other antibiotics to see if they also may be effective in preventing aids-related infections, she said
ms. fischl speculated that the medical technique known as chemoprophylaxis _ trying to prevent infections with low doses of antibotics _ may become a major weapon against aids and be used in conjunction with other drugs, such as azt
azt, or azidothymidine, has been shown to prolong the lives of aids patients by reducing the frequency and severity of opportunistic infections, like the rare pneumonia
perhaps the combination of chemoprophylaxis with azt will improve the outcome better than either alone,'' said ms. fischl, who also has directed studies of azt
the virus that causes aids is believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth
a 17-year-old student athlete became a hero for the third time in his life when he went to the aid of a man whose van had plunged into a canyon, giving the man his jacket and shirt to ward off hypothermia
duane duffy was on his way home from a school club meeting in colorado springs on tuesday night when he saw a strange light in the trees in the canyon 300 feet below the road
i knew it wasn't the moon,'' duffy said. ``most people would drive right by, because if you didn't know any better you wouldn't have noticed it.''
but duffy drives the road every day, so he stopped to investigate
peering over the precipice, he saw the headlights of a smashed van and heard a weak cry for help
tom dize, 44, of denver, had slipped off the road into the canyon while attempting a u-turn
duffy went off and called for help, then returned to climb down the nearly vertical dropoff. he found dize in bad condition
i thought he was really getting close to hypothermia,'' or low body temperature, said duffy. ``he'd been out there 15 to 20 minutes, sprawled in the snow, and it was really deep. he was shaking and shivering. he was all wet and white, and breathing heavily. it really freaked me out.''
i knew i was going to die,'' dize recalled from his hospital bed
duffy helped dize walk to the road, then took off his jacket and shirt and wrapped the injured man in them and in blankets from his car. he waited with dize until an ambulance arrived
if it hadn't been for him, i might not have made it,'' said dize, who was in satisfactory condition at st. anthony hospital central in denver, where he was recovering from internal injuries
he put the blankets on me, comforted me, stayed with me. i owe my life to him, really.''
duffy's father, duane duffy, said his son had rescued a brother and sister years earlier
when he was 12, he saved his 10-year-old brother from drowning during a fishing trip. two years ago, he treated his 3-year-old sister after she ate rat poison, making her drink milk to coat her stomach and calling paramedics
like every teen, he's rebellious,'' said the father. ``but being the oldest of seven children, he's assumed a lot of leadership. you can criticize kids from day to day, get down on them, and you forget to look at the basic things. we've tried to teach the kids good values, and it looks like i've gotten some reward for that.''
reps. charles e. schumer, d-n.y., and joseph p. kennedy, d-mass., introduced legislation thursday designed to aid consumers in their dealing with banks
schumer and kennedy, both members of the house banking committee _ joined by a coalition of representatives of consumer groups, including activist ralph nader _ told a news conference they hoped their measure would be included in major legislation to restructure banking regulations
as the bank and securities industries argue about how to divide up the goodies of the financial system, congress must make sure that consumers get a fair shake,'' said schumer. ``whether or not congress grants banks any new powers, congress must address the concerns of consumers and communities.''
kennedy said that no matter what congress does on the glass-steagall law, which restricts the role of banks, ``local communities and consumers deserve to have their rights under the law enforced.''
schumer and kennedy said their legislation will offer an opportunity for every person to have a bank account, establish community organizations to monitor bank performance and will provide better information about the credit given to businesses in poor communities
the measure requires that banks make available basic checking accounts to all consumers for a minimal initial deposit. these accounts would be free of all fees and charges for a limited number of checking services
it also will require regular disclosure of where banks are lending their depositors' money, giving consumers a better picture of whether the banks they patronize are serving the community which supports them, according to schumer
a third provision would establish a system of state-level organizations to inform and represent consumers' interests before regulatory authorities, courts, legislatures and other forums
southeast asian heroin importers have supplanted the mafia as the largest supplier of the drug in new york, vastly increasing their share of the illicit market since 1983, authorities said thursday
however, investigations of the drug rings have led to major recent seizures of new york-bound heroin in thailand and chicago, said robert strang, spokesman for the federal drug enforcement administration here
five years ago an estimated 4 percent of the heroin reaching new york was from southeast asia and the remaining 96 percent was from iran, afghanistan and pakistan, where the mafia dominated the distribution network, strang said
now, an estimated 70 percent of the heroin comes from southeast asia _ principally thailand, laos and burma _ imported by gangs based in hong kong and bangkok, while the share from iran, afghanistan and pakistan is down to 30 percent, he said
officials are unsure of the reason for the decreasing role of organized crime, but they speculate that one factor is retrenchment and disarray in the mafia ranks caused by recent successful prosecutions of mafia leaders in new york
the southeast asian heroin has an average street-level purity of 45 percent, compared with 15 percent for heroin from iran, afghanistan and pakistan, strang noted. nonetheless, wholesale prices have remained level, ranging from $75,000 to $150,000 per pound, he said
the dea responded to the increasing role of bangkok and hong kong heroin gangs by forming a special investigative group 1{ years ago, strang said. the group led to seizures of 180 pounds of heroin in new york in december, 165 pounds this week in chicago and nearly 1{ tons in thailand earlier this month
a bomb exploded near a crowded stage late thursday and wounded 14 people at the climax of celebrations marking the second anniversary of the popular uprising that ousted president ferdinand e. marcos
brig. gen. rodolfo biazon, chief of the national capital region defense command, told the associated press there was no indication who planted the homemade device, and no one claimed responsibility. the military had been on full alert in case communist rebels or militant rightists tried to disrupt the celebration
biazon said the bomb went off during a fireworks display at the end of daylong celebrations marking the feb. 25, 1986 ouster of the marcos administration
elisa florido, a nurse at medical city hospital, said no one was seriously hurt. she said most of the injured suffered cuts from flying glass and debris
the blast occurred at about 10 p.m. near the main stage set up on epifanio de los santos avenue. seven stages were erected along the highway, known as edsa, for religious services and performances by filipino entertainers
two years ago, hundreds of thousands of filipinos swarmed onto edsa to form a human wall shielding troops who mutinied against marcos after a fraud-tainted election. the uprising swept corazon aquino into the presidency
during a mass attended by mrs. aquino thursday, cardinal jaime l. sin, archbishop of manila, appealed for land reform and warned that the country cannot survive if it does not narrow the gap between rich and poor
we have to bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth throughout our land,'' sin said. ``only then can our nation survive and go forward
it (land reform) can no longer wait. many believe it is already too late. the insurgency, now so much advanced, is at the gates.''
more than half the nation's 58 million people live in poverty that has fueled the 19-year-old communist rebellion
mrs. aquino ordered land reform last july but left implementing details to congress, where the bill has bogged down because of resistance by landowners
during the mass, mrs. aquino made no speech but offered a prayer:
lord god, you helped us on edsa two years ago, and we thank you for helping us all through these difficult two years. ... we believe that you led us out of bondage. we believe that it was you who made us free.''
about 10,000 leftists marked the day with a march and rally, at which speakers claimed mrs. aquino had abandoned the reformist goals of the 1986 revolution. hundreds of marcos supporters also rallied to demand his return from exile in hawaii
in honolulu, marcos said that after two years in exile, he considers himself a prisoner in the united states. he vowed to continue his fight to return home, though he said he expects to be killed by his enemies
u.s. officials will not allow marcos to return to the philippines because the aquino government believes he and his wife would disrupt the country's political stability
the explosion thursday night was the only incident that marred the celebrations in manila, in which tens of thousands of filipinos returned to edsa for a carnival of religious processions and street dancing
the celebration began with the pealing of church bells across the nation and a flag-raising ceremony at camp aguinaldo military garrison. mrs. aquino joined thousands of people outside the camp to hold hands in a 1{-mile-long ``chain for peace'' down edsa
it was at camp aguinaldo where former defense minister juan ponce enrile and lt. gen. fidel ramos, then the vice chief of staff, announced they were breaking with marcos and backing mrs. aquino
the mutiny galvanized opposition to marcos which swelled after the 1983 assassination of mrs. aquino's husband, former sen. benigno aquino jr
mrs. aquino promised broad social and economic reform, but critics complain she failed to meet the goals because of strong opposition from conservative groups within the military and the elite. chief</head>
a man taken into custody at a campus dormitory grabbed an officer's gun and opened fire early thursday, wounding three people before fleeing, authorities said
the suspect, believed to be a 28-year-old student, apparently is the same person who was arrested wednesday after allegedly fighting with a former roommate at the university of houston-downtown dorm. that man was released from the harris county jail later wednesday, officials said
he returned to the dorm and started making threats,'' university spokeswoman martha cantu said. ``i think (the threats) were in general.''
campus police were called to the dorm to check on a reported disturbance. one person was taken into custody and then moved to the university's main building, where two campus police officers and a maintenance worker were wounded during a scuffle, university spokesman andy gomez said
there were conflicting reports as to what time the student was first taken into custody. gomez said it was about 2:30 a.m. thursday, but ms. cantu said the student may have been taken into custody late wednesday
ms. cantu said that the shootings occurred after campus officer jim durbin tried to handcuff the suspect, who apparently got durbin's .357-caliber revolver during a scuffle and fired four shots
durbin was in good condition with a wound in an armpit, ms. cantu said. the other officer was shot in the head and was in serious condition and the maintenance worker underwent surgery thursday, she said
classes continued thursday for the estimated 7,200 students enrolled at the downtown branch of the university of houston
a 16-year-old black girl who says she was kidnapped and raped by six white men would sooner go to jail than testify before a grand jury empaneled by state attorney general robert abrams, a minister said thursday
the rev. al sharpton, a minister from new york city who is advising the family of tawana brawley, said gov. mario cuomo is using ``macho politics'' in trying to compel testimony from the girl from wappingers falls, north of new york city
i see no fear for her (tawana), her family, her lawyers and myself for going to jail,'' said sharpton, who said he met earlier thursday with the brawley family. ``you're probably safer in jail than you are in the streets.''
miss brawley was found wrapped in a garbage bag and covered with feces, with racial insults scrawled on her body, after being missing for four days last november. she said she was assaulted by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge
on wednesday cuomo called on abrams, who he has appointed as a special prosecutor in the case, to ask a grand jury when it convenes monday in poughkeepsie to force miss brawley and her family to cooperate with investigators
someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a young girl who has already been abused,'' sharpton said of cuomo
according to sharpton, the brawleys and their advisers continue to seek assurances that abrams will be personally involved in the investigation and trial of the case. in addition, he said the family remains troubled by what he maintains is the ``special relationship'' between abrams and dutchess county sheriff frederick scoralick, who one newspaper has reported as being implicated in the case by miss brawley
the family's advisers are also concerned that abrams has not posted a reward for information in the case and that details of private meetings between the attorney general and brawley attorneys c. vernon mason and alton maddox jr. earlier this month were revealed by abrams' office
timothy gilles, spokesman for abrams, did not return a phone call seeking comment thursday
maddox and mason, of new york city, have called for abrams' ouster as special prosecutor and asked for the naming of a permanent state prosecutor to investigate race-related crimes
the brawleys, sharpton said, have even less trust in the state since tuesday's revelation that a former printing employee of abrams was arrested and charged with stealing and disclosing a transcript of testimony taken before a previous dutchess county grand jury
they have made a joke of the grand jury by the robbery,'' sharpton said. ``are you going to tell me that if tawana goes before the grand jury that a printer isn't going to rob her testimony?''
john poklemba, cuomo's aide who advised the governor on the appointment of a special prosecutor, said wednesday that despite the objections of miss brawley's representatives, he saw no reason to remove abrams from the case
sharpton noted that miss brawley and her family have defied a grand jury subpoena already. that court order was issued earlier this year at the request of dutchess county district attorney william grady, who later asked to be removed from the case because of an unspecified conflicts of interest. artifacts</head>
tougher federal laws are needed to stem the dramatically increased rate of indian artifacts looted and vandalized in the southwest, a house subcommittee said thursday
a report by the house interior and insular affairs subcommittee on general oversight and investigations, capping a four-month probe, said up to 90 percent of the archaeological indian sites in arizona, colorado, new mexico and utah may have been vandalized
the subcommittee called it an ``extremely serious problem which threatens our national heritage.''
the 73-page report, issued by rep. sam gejdenson, d-conn., chairman of the panel, said vandalism reports have increased by 1,000 percent since 1980 on the navajo reservation alone
if the rate of looting on other indian lands is as serious ... the looting problem on indian land is reaching crisis proportions,'' the subcommittee concluded
looting in the southwest is especially severe because of the value of certain artifacts. for example, an indian basket and its contents were sold by a dealer for $180,000
the panel recommended revising a law currently in effect that separates misdemeanors and felonies by a $5,000 threshold on the artifacts stolen or destroyed. instead, the report suggested making digging for artifacts a felony and ``surface collecting'' a misdeamanor
the $5,000 threshold causes many problems as it is extremely difficult to quantify the value of damage to archaeological sites,'' the report said. ``this is a clear distinction, which juries and judges can understand without the assistance of an expert.''
the subcommittee also said the law should be changed to make it a crime to attempt to loot or vandalize archaeological sites on federal lands. now looters have to be caught in the act
the panel wants to have the law apply to artifacts that are at least 50 years old, instead of the current 100-year-old standard
in addition, the lawmakers called for more undercover operations and patrols, including patrols at archaeological sites that are important but not protected under the national historic preservation act
the subcommittee said the government should focus on education and advertising efforts, noting that while many looters are seeking a profit, some are just archaeology enthusiasts unaware of the need to protect the artifacts
the key to protecting archaeological resources is to convince the general public of their value,'' the report said. picking up in 7th graf pvs, during his</note>
two top strategists for republican presidential candidate bob dole were fired thursday in the culmination of an apparent power struggle that erupted as the kansas senator was grearing up for the single biggest day of the 1988 campaign
consultants david keene and don devine left dole's campaign in florida, according to campaign manager bill brock
we're in the process of trying to tighten up on resources,'' dole said, but he also acknowledged, ``there is tension in any campaign.''
brock said he decided on the firings and notified dole wednesday night
we don't have any philosophical differences,'' said brock, a former senator from tennessee. ``we're in a different kind of campaign at this time.''
brock said other changes were forthcoming, adding that some dole personnel in the national headquarters would be asked to go into the field for the kansas senator
keene and devine flew with dole on the candidate's chartered plane when he headed south from minnesota on wednesday after his victories in the south dakota primary and minnesota precinct caucuses
devine, in a telephone interview, said brock had called them tuesday night and ordered them off the plane
both refused, saying they worked for dole
brock joined the entourage thursday in orlando, fla., after a day of campaign stops in south carolina and florida. and devine said that while dole was delivering a speech, a photographer asked brock and keene to stand together for a picture
according to devine, as the two men stood together, brock leaned over and said to keene, ``we're going to cut the string on you right now.''
then he looked at devine and said, ``i might as well do both of you together.''
devine said the dispute flared when brock advised dole not to go to south dakota and minnesota tuesday night, despite indications the senator would carry both states
keene and devine argued that dole should go and the senator agreed
during his appearance before the jacksonville chamber of commerce, dole said he considered the republican race a two-man battle between himself and vice president george bush
i've got a feeling we may be headed all the way to new orleans,'' said dole, referring to the republican national convention in august
aiming his remarks at conservative republicans in a city that hosts three huge naval bases, dole praised president reagan's leadership and pitched his remarks toward strong support of the strategic defense initiative. but he also urged resolving the federal budget deficit
the biggest single threat in america ... in my view, is the deficit,'' said dole. ``you have a right to insist we deal with the deficit.''
dole said the country needed to control wasteful pentagon spending with an inspector general ``meaner than a junkyard dog,'' but said he would not compromise on defense
if i'm going to make a mistake on defense, i ant to be sure i've spent enough,'' said the senator
dole also spoke before the florida association of counties mid-year legislative congress and attended a rally on his behalf before flyig to texas
florida and texas are the two largest of the 20 states that have contests on march 8, known as super tuesday
earlier, at an orlando campaign stop, dole told reporters that bush had brought a disinformation campaign to florida
dole complained that tv ads now running in miami, which were also used by the bush campaign in new hampshire and vermont, distort dole's views on several issues
he said the ads say that ``dole can't wait to raise your taxes, then there's something about import fees and something about the inf (nuclear missiles) treaty _ all of which is totally inaccurate.''
later, posing at the universal studios construction site with cartoon and movie characters woody woodpecker and frankenstein's monster, the kansas senator quipped that ``we have a broad-based campaign. ... it's reaching new heights.''
doug watson says he's not the greatest salesman who ever lived, but then how many of his competitors can say they've sold 117,000 pounds of ice to fairbanks, alaska?
the ice, 390 blocks weighing 300 pounds each, was loaded into refrigerator trucks thursday for the first leg of the voyage to the fairbanks ice festival
the price tage was $2,350 with the fairbanks convention and visitor bureau also paying for the shipping
the shipment from rainier ice co. is due in fairbanks on march 7, in time for three ice sculptors from harbin, china, to render their artwork by the festival's march 18 start
i thought when they called me about buying the ice that it gets cold up there and they should have all they want,'' watson said
we don't have the right kind of ice in alaska,'' said susan stolpe, a spokeswoman for the fairbanks convention bureau. ``we need de-oxygenated ice, which is clearer.''
the ice festival runs through march 20 and celebrates the approach of spring with dogsled races, art exhibits and a parade of locally made parkas
employees at a downtown office building have received a memo suggesting that their visits to restrooms be wrapped up in 12 minutes _ or they'll be left in the dark
motion sensors that control lights will be installed in the next few weeks in all restrooms of the building occupied by cities service oil and gas corp
the sensors will detect motion when people pass and turn on lights. if no motion is detected for 12 minutes, the devices will turn the lights out, according to the memo
a spokesman said the devices have been tested in one men's room in the building and have been found to be effective in reducing electricity use
the united states plays a pivotal role in portugal's former african colony of angola and has a chance to end cuban and south african involvement there in the next four months, portugese prime minister anibal cavaco silva said
this is the right time,'' cavaco silva told the national press club. ``if the agreement is not obtained, it is my opinion, in the next four months, perhaps it will not be achieved in the next two years.''
the main factor, he said, is next november's u.s. elections and the change of administrations
perhaps the next administration will take some time, perhaps two years, to make a new assessment of foreign policy in relation to that area,'' cavaco silva said. ``and it would be a pity because the suffering of the people will continue, and the opportunities of economic recovery will be lost.''
cavaco silva said he had discussed angola with president reagan on wednesday and also with secretary of state george shultz and chester crocker, assistant secretary of state for african affairs
crocker has been conducting talks with the angolan government for much of the reagan administration to try to arrange a pullout of some 40,000 cuban troops from angola, which would be coordinated with south africa's granting independence to south-west africa, or namibia
the government of angola is experiencing big difficulties _ economic difficulties of the decline in oil prices,'' cacavo silva said. it also has suffered a setback in recent fighting with unita rebels, in part because of the intervention of south african troops, he said. government troops ``are on retreat now,'' he said
the united states administration is in a position to achieve a retreat of the cuban troops and to explain the arrangement to the south africans ... and to force the necessary steps for the independence of namibia,'' cavaco silva said
he said his government has urged angola to reach an agreement now and that the angolan government has accepted the principle of the total withdrawal of the cuban troops. ``the difficulty is to fix the timetable,'' he said
it is necessary to have in mind that that agreement afterwards has to be negotiated with south africa,'' cavaco silva said. ``and south africa this time has been openly involved. for the first time, they say that the african troops are there.''
he said he was less able to see any quick resolution to the fighting between the angolan government and unita
four current and former employees of northrop corp. have filed a lawsuit accusing the aerospace giant of overcharging the government by more than $1 billion for development of the radar-dodging stealth bomber
the pentagon is investigating the allegations in the latest in a series of inqueries involving alleged mishandling by northrop of military programs
the stealth is northrop's ``crown jewel,'' accounting for about half of its net income and a third of its workforce
last month, the air force confirmed it had awarded a $2 billion contract to northrop in the first infusion of regular production funds for the plane. only northrop got a contract, despite arguments by critics that the air force should seek a second source for the planes because of northrop's problems
in the 1990s, the pentagon is expected to deploy 132 stealth bombers at a cost of $36.6 billion
the plane, designed to be difficult to detect on enemy radar, is under development at northrop's plants in pico rivera and palmdale
the investigation by the air force and the pentagon inspector general's office was revealed wednesday after a u.s. district court suit was filed by the one current and three former employees under the federal false claims act
under that act, citizens are allowed to sue on behalf of the government and share in any damage award
the government must routinely investigate allegations in such suit, and the justice department must decide within 60 days if there is sufficient evidence for the government to join the suit or seek its dismissal
northrop spokesman tony cantafio refused comment, citing company policies against responding publicly to lawsuits and against making statements regarding the super-secret stealth bomber
the suit, which was sealed under procedures followed in such cases, accuses northrop of double-billing, false billing and misrepresented charges, said robert kilborne, the attorney representing the plaintiffs
kilborne identified his clients only as an internal auditor, a former controller, a former avionics engineer and a former test equipment engineer
the suit alleges that northrop destroyed internal audits that turned up evidence of $400 million in improper charges on development of the bomber, predicting that such overcharges may actually total $1 billion
wednesday's suit is the fourth such action brought by kilborne or his law partner, herb hafif, against northrop. the other suits involved northrop's work on the mx missile program
in october, the justice department moved to dismiss one of the earlier suits on grounds that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations. ^panama city: delvalle said.</head>
noriega, as head of the military, has been considered the power behind panama's civilian government
demonstrations broke out in panama last june demanding noriega's resignation. relations have deteriorated between the united states and panama since then
the reagan administration publicly called for noriega to step down following his indictment on drug trafficking charges in february by a federal grand jury in miami
an off-duty police officer shot and killed a man who challenged him to fire and reached for a knife thursday, police said, bringing to six the number of people who have died in dallas police shootings in less than two months
the shootings have exacerbated racial tensions in dallas. two of the police department's most vocal critics are black members of the city council, who contend department's deadly force policy hurts minorities
both the officer and the slain man in thursday's shooting were black
according to police, the man ordered to waitresses to empty a restaurant cash register, and was confronted bu officer cloyce addison shannon
go ahead and shoot me; shoot me,'' the man told shannon as he reached for a weapon tucked in his weapon, police reports said
shannon, 29, shot the man twice in the chest. he was pronounced dead at the scene, police lt. ron waldrop said
the officer was under the impression that the weapon was a gun, but it turned out to be a long-bladed knife with a handle similar to that of a pistol, waldrop said
the dallas county medical examiner's office identified the victim as robert keith johnson, 30, of dallas
six people have died in five shootings involving dallas police this year, including a black transient slain by off-duty police after he killed a white officer in a downtown parking lot as some members of a street-corner crowd cheered him on
the department has come under fire for its use of deadly force and has been criticized as being out of touch with the minority community
police capt. rick stone, who helped write the department's deadly force policy, said the use of such force is limited to the defense of life
officers are prevented from firing warning shots and are prevented from using deadly force to protect property interests alone,'' he said. ``in essence, the officer must feel that either he or another individual is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.''
police chief billy prince, who issued no statement on latest shooting, was criticized by city officials last month for blaming the death of officer john chase on council members. prince said some members' criticism of the department created an environment of potential violence
price was criticized again wednesday by mayor annette strauss and city manager richard knight for comments concerning the department's affirmative action program, implemented following chase's death
prince said the new policy forced him to promote a black officer who had scored one point lower on a civil rights exam than three white candidates
fueling the racially tense atmosphere were plans by the ku klux klan to march saturday
the kkk is abhorrent to the dallas police department,'' prince said in a statement. ``we did not solicit and do not want their support
we regret the organization's plans to demonstrate in dallas saturday and strongly urge them to abandon the planned demonstration.''
in the other police shootings this year, officer james joe was shot while off-duty as he investigating a burglary at the apartment complex where he lived
the other two victims were shot by police last week. one was black and one was white
the sudden change of currency to combat runaway inflation, accomplished largely by lopping zeros off the old one, has caused confusion, shortages of staples and some cheating
we are in a horrible crisis,'' said julia duarte, a fruit vendor at the open-air eastern market in managua. ``we don't have rice, beans, and people are going hungry.''
president daniel ortega, citing a yearly inflation rate of 1,500 percent, announced feb. 14 that the cordoba currency was being revalued at 10 to the dollar. at that time a dollar was worth 20,000 cordobas on the legal rate and 50,000 on the black market
his government said the new currency would end the black market, foil a cia plan to flood the country with the old money, and deprive the u.s.-supported contra rebels of nicaraguan bills supplied by the cia
after ortega announced the change, the opposition private enterprise council predicted it would drive real prices higher
the black market has continued, despite threats that participants would be arrested, and the contras claimed they got $1 million worth of the new money by downing a sandinista helicopter carrying the cash
store owners said they were bewildered by the change in money and many closed for several days. rice and beans, staples for nicaraguans, disappeared from store shelves
the intercontinental hotel, unsure of how the new system worked, charged $46 for breakfast, and $16 for a chicken sandwich
nicaraguans had three days to trade their old money for new. those who were out of the country or otherwise missed the deadline found the old bills worthless
prices set by the government have increased sharply in objective terms. on a dollar scale, a dozen eggs went from just under $1 to $2.50, an average restaurant meal featuring beef went from under $10 to $25, and gasoline rose from about 60 cents a gallon to $1.50
a new scale set monthly wages from $50 to $753. at a store recently, the cost of a shirt was $33 and jeans were marked at the equivalent of $66
la prensa, the opposition newspaper la prensa said in an editorial that the daily wage in 1979, when the cordoba was last valued at 10 to the dollar, was $15.20 and now it is $16.66. it also noted that meat cost $7.22 a pound then and is $35 now
the leftist sandinistas overthrew president anastasio somoza in july 1979, ending a family dynasty that had been in power 42 years
a few days after the currency change, police swept through the eastern market, broke some wooden stalls with clubs and confiscated goods sold by vendors operating without licenses
the government said more than 3,000 vendors at the market had been operating illegally
the police come, they push out some of the vendors, and they take and resell the stuff,'' said mrs. duarte, 60, sitting in front of large straw baskets filled with golden mangos and green oranges
we have to work harder than ever,'' said a nearby vegetable vendor, miguel sanchez sales. ``this new money isn't worth anything either. we used to eat on 10 cordobas a day. now we're lucky if we can get by on 100.''
a request from columnist jack anderson's associate to cabinet officers to tell all about vice president george bush got a brusque reply thursday from secretary of education william j. bennett
dale van atta, co-author of the anderson column, wrote all 34 present and former reagan cabinet members who have served with bush, asking them to rate him as presidential timber
calling bush ``a mystery to the voters,'' the columnist asked for instances where bush influenced policy decisions or actions, and warned that a failure to reply ``may send a negative message about mr. bush.''
bennett's wrote back that it was ``nonsense'' to call bush a mystery to the voters. he also said he would not violate the confidentiality of cabinet discussions, or ``the president's injunction to all his cabinet members to stay neutral in the presidential race.''
finally, and most incredibly, you threaten that you will construe a refusal to accede to your demands as sending `a negative message about mr. bush.' i cannot believe anyone will credit such a perverse interpretation,'' said bennett
i am confident that the american people will judge the vice president's distinguished record of public service on its merits.''
bush has said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he wants to be known as ``the education president.'' bennett has been mentioned as a possible running mate for whoever wins the republican nomination
american schools are still having trouble trying to make good readers out of poor ones, according to a federal released thursday
the report from the government-backed testing program, the national assessment of education progress, said poor readers are left at a disadvantage by teachers who help them figure out hard words but neglect to make them discuss the meaning of the entire passage
american schools continue to have difficulty in narrowing the performance gap between better and poorer readers as they progress through school,'' said the report, ``who reads best?'' the study was based on an analysis of reading tests the national assessment gave 35,000 students ages 9, 13 and 17 in 1986
the national assessment, run under a federal contract by the educational testing service, refrained from making any comparisons between these test results and such assessments of reading in 1984 and earlier
ets officials revealed last month there were sharp, unexplained declines in reading scores among the 9- and 17-year-olds in 1986. they suspect something went wrong in the test itself, not the students' performance
there were no sharp declines in other subjects tested in 1986, they noted
the new report said there is still no explanation for the ``precipitous declines'' in reading, which it called ``simply not believable.''
the national assessment switched to a different scale to report the 1986 test results. but officials expressed complete confidence in the conclusions reached in ``who reads best?''
the report suggests teachers use the same ``thought-stretching activities'' for poor readers that they routinely employ with better readers
students had ``particular difficulty with tasks that require them to elaborate upon or defend their evaluations and interpretations of what they have read,'' it said
poor readers report doing less independent reading than good readers,'' it said. ``poor readers report that their teachers use a narrower range of (instructional) approaches than are used with better readers.''
they focus more on decoding strategies than comprehension and critical thinking, it said
in the elementary grades, teachers of better readers are more likely to preview reading material and read new parts aloud to the class _ both activities which emphasize the meaning of the selection,'' it said
at the high school level, better readers reported more previewing of material, while poorer readers indicated their teachers more frequently pointed out the hard words and read new parts aloud.''
younger students and those in the bottom quarter of reading scores generally were exposed to fewer instructional strategies, while older students and those in the top 25 percent reported engaging ``in more before-and after-reading activities.''
they were ``more likely to be asked to engage in thought-stretching activities after they have finished their reading of the text,'' the report said. noriega. no pickup.</note>
the president on thursday ordered the removal of gen. manuel antonio noriega, the panamanian strongman who has been accused of illicit activities and indicted in the united states on drug trafficking charges
in a nationally broadcast message, delvalle said he had asked noriega several days ago to step down voluntarily so that an investigation of charges of illicit activities could be launched. he said the general declined
there is no other alternative but the use of the powers that the constitution gives me, to separate general noriega from his high command and to encharge the leadership of the institution to the current chief of staff, col. marcos justine,'' delvalle said
there was no immediate indication of whether noriega would comply with the order or if it would be carried out by his officers
the military has long been regarded as the real power in panama, with its chief considered the de facto ruler of the country
the reagan administration has been calling on noriega to step down since his indictment by a federal grand jury in miami on drug trafficking charges on feb. 5. the two indictments portrayed noriega as a key member of an international drug trafficking conspiracy
demonstrations against noriega broke out in panama last june after the military chief's recently retired second in command publicly charged the general with illicit activities ranging from drug trafficking to electoral fraud and the assassination of a political opponent. the military chief said he was innocent
delvalle talked to u.s. authorities last wednesday at an unannounced meeting in miami
reagan administration officials said they received discreet inquiries about u.s. willingness to drop federal drug charges against noriega
in his speech thursday, delvalle said: ``panama currently is experiencing one of the most difficult and dangerous moments of its history.''
he added that he reached his decision because of the ``immense seriousness'' of the situation and ``the fruitlessness of my efforts.''
delvalle said he ordered noriega out as chief of the defense forces of panama ``to allow justice to continue an impartial course without pressures of any kind.''
delvalle was inaugurated in september 1985 after elected president nicolas ardito barletta resigned in a dispute with noriega. delvalle previously was a little known civilian who had run for first vice president on the official party ticket
ardito barletta had been the first elected civilian president to take office in panama in 16 years, although the 1984 vote was marred by charges of vote fraud engineered by the military
noriega and his supporters have said those criticizing the military leader are trying to break the panama canal treaty, under which the united states agreed to cede control of the canal on dec. 31, 1999
noriega has recently criticized the u.s. southern command, headquarters for all u.s. military activities in latin america
the pentagon and the white house interpreted his remarks as a call for the transfer of the 10,000 servicemen and their 20,000 dependents from panamanian soil
washington rejected such a move, saying the american troops were legally in the country and would remain in panama to protect the canal until it is handed over to panama
in washington, a pentagon spokeswoman said thursday that the u.s. southern command had not been put on any type of alert as a result of delvalle's action
everything is normal,'' said capt. nancy laluntas, the spokeswoman. ``they might be advising (personnel) to avoid demonstrations, but the command is on normal status at the moment.''
noriega attended a military college in peru on a scholarship, then entered the panamanian national guard in 1962 as a lieutenant. he quickly became acquainted with a rising young officer named omar torrijos
torrijos took power in panama in a 1968 coup and less than a year later named noriega, then an obscure major in charge of the country's northernmost province, as his chief of intelligence with the rank of lieutenant colonel
the job put noriega in touch with u.s. intelligence agencies interested in any potential threats to the security of the panama canal, a vital shipping link between the atlantic and pacific oceans
when torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981, noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top command ahead of several more senior officers. he took power in 1983
during his birthday speech earlier this month, noriega declared: ``if they want me out, they'll have to kill me.'' 11th graf, robertson did</note>
pat robertson defended himself against president reagan's critical comments thursday, saying his christian broadcasting network did give the administration information on american hostages in 1985. robertson said he mentioned it wednesday merely as ``a throwaway line.''
reacting to reagan's public skepticism, robertson said at a louisville campaign stop, ``i wasn't meaning to start some major confrontation with a person i admire tremendously, but obviously the state department must have dismissed what we had to say, or else they didn't refer it up the line to the president.''
later, at a stop in birmingham, ala., robertson said of his statements about having known the hostages whereabouts, ``i used that as a throwaway line'' to illustrate that the nation needed to improve its methods of dealing with terrorists
he said it was ``hard to understand why there has been such an incredible flap.''
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said she had no immediate response to robertson's newest comments about having giving information to the department but would look into the matter further
reagan, during his nationally broadcast news conference wednesday night, questioned robertson's contentions that in 1985 he had known the whereabouts of hostages in the middle east ``where they could have been rescued.''
it'd be very strange if he actually did have information as to the location of those hostages,'' reagan said. ``isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?''
if he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself,'' reagan added
robertson, campaigning in louisville on thursday, complained that what he had said about the hostages ``was, i'm afraid, misinterpreted.''
in atlanta on wednesday, the republican presidential candidate had said, ``we identified in our news department at cbn the location of those hostages in lebanon very shortly after they were taken, and they were in a position where they could have been rescued. they were in beirut, and they could have been freed.''
robertson did not say which hostages he was talking about
nine americans are in captivity in lebanon, including marine lt. col. william r. higgins, who was captured last week. terry anderson, chief middle east correspondent of the associated press, is the longest-held captive; he was kidnapped on march 16, 1985
a cbn spokesman, benton miller, later said the former television evangelist's comments pertained to hostages who had been taken from twa flight 847 in beirut in june 1985
one passenger, navy diver robert stethem, was killed after the plane was hijacked. the passengers kept as hostages after the plane landed in beirut were later released
the state department, from what my staff tells me, did inquire of us concerning what knowledge we had of that twa hijacking,'' robertson said thursday. ``our reporter did identify the names of the captors and identified them as being close to nabih berri and what is called hezbollah.''
we knew the captors and we had the basic area of beirut where they were being held,'' he said
a state department expert on terrorism has said such information probably would not be enough to mount a rescue effort
robertson's comments on wednesday were criticized by two of his republican presidential rivals, vice president george bush and rep. jack kemp of new york
bush, said, ``my question would be, how come he didn't get hold of the proper authorities in the united states government that were working day and night, trying to figure out how they could get these people out?''
kemp, in a statement, called robertson's statements irresponsible and said he should ``apologize to the families of the hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt to gain publicity.''
while jimmy swaggart contends with the fallout from his self-confessed moral lapse, his ministry is battling litigation involving taxes on a church radio station and allegations he skimmed ministry profits
one case concerns the tax status of the station, kjoj-fm in shenandoah. the louisiana-based ministry sued county authorities over their denial of a tax exemption for the station, which the ministry contends is a place of worship
in two other cases, city and school authorities are seeking more than $130,000 in delinquent taxes and other claims involving the christian station
an attorney for the ministry, james w. bradford jr., did not immediately return telephone calls thursday
russell r. graham, an attorney for the montgomery county appraisal district, said the station does not meet the legal definition of a place of worship. the agency denied the station tax-exempt status in 1982
he said the agency's defense in the ministry lawsuit had been hampered by the ministry's reluctance to reveal financial information. but he said the county has received ``considerable cooperation'' from the ministry since the county agreed to a judge's order in july sealing further filings in the case until the april 4 trial
in motions filed last year, the ministry revealed it collected $455.8 million in contributions and sales of religious materials from 1979 to 1985. contributions rose about 25 percent annually since 1979, financial statements show
the ministry had claimed the operation did not make a profit, but a 1982 financial statement showed $11.9 million classified as ``excess revenues'' after expenses
graham, in a letter to the judge obtained last year by the texas lawyer magazine, had complained that the ministry would not provide detailed accounting of millions of dollars in ``excess profits.''
tax officials ``believe that further discovery will reflect that jimmy swaggart retained these funds for his personal use,'' the letter said
the texas statute on exemptions provides that not only does the use of the property have to fit the narrow definition of what is exempt, but you have to use income for accepted purposes under the statute and avoid a situation where anyone receives any private gain,'' graham said
ministry lawyers have denied that swaggart skimmed ministry profits
hinging on the outcome of the montgomery county suit are tax cases against the ministry by the city of shenandoah, set for a march 21 trial, and by the conroe independent school district, for which no trial date has been set
shenandoah claims the ministry owes nearly $60,000 on the station from 1980-87 and on its equipment from 1981-87, city attorney michael j. darlow said
the school district claims it is owed more than $70,000 in back taxes from the radio station, its contents and a broadcast tower, said school attorney robert a. mott
the legislation that has snarled the senate in a filibuster is a democratic response to the escalating cost of getting elected to congress
the bill, being pushed heavily by the self-described citizens lobby, common cause, has 52 co-sponsors, all of whom are democrats except robert stafford, r-vt., and john chafee, r-r.i
it would set up a system to encourage senate candidates in general elections to voluntarily observe spending limits ranging from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a state's population
in 1986, the average cost of winning a senate seat was $3 million, a fivefold increase from 1976. in larger states, the cost in 1986 often exceeded $10 million
under the democrats' plan, a candidate observing the state spending limit would be allowed to put no more than $20,000 in personal funds into the campaign
in an effort to curb the growing role of political action committees as a source of campaign money, a participating candidate could get no more than 20 percent of his or her money from pacs. in 1986, pacs provided more than half the money spent by more than 200 house and senate candidates
a candidate observing the limit would be eligible for campaign money from the treasury if an opponent did not adhere to the limit. tax dollars also would be awarded in cases in which a participating candidate was the target of heavy spending by independent groups
a participating candidate also would be eligible for reduced mailing rates. the bill would require radio and television stations to charge the candidate the ``lowest unit rates'' for advertising
campaign ads by candidates not observing spending limits would have to carry the disclaimer, ``this candidate has not agreed to abide by voluntary spending limits.''
most of the nation enjoyed mostly sunny skies thursday thanks to a large high-pressure zone, while snow fell over parts of the midwest and new york state
the snow, ranging from flurries to major accumulation, fell from lower michigan across the eastern great lakes to upstate new york, with heavier snow squalls near lakes erie and ontario
up to 17 inches was dumped on pulaski, n.y., overnight thursday, and up to 8 inches fell at oswego, n.y., between midnight and 7 a.m. est
three to 5 inches of snow fell thursday morning in ohio's geauga and lake counties, while 2 to 3 inches covered downtown cleveland
light rain fell in northwest washington state, and a trace of rain fell in parts of the texas rio grande valley
temperatures remained low in the northeast, with midday readings mostly in the teens and 20s from the upper mississippi valley across the great lakes and northern sections of the ohio valley to the northern and central appalachians. winds of 10 to 20 mph produced wind chills in the single digits as far south as bluefield, w.v
temperatures warmed into the 60s, 70s and 80s across the desert southwest. readings in the 60s were also common across the southern plains, louisiana and southern and central florida
temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. est ranged from 14 at gunnison, colo., to 87 at palm springs, calif. the early-morning low for the nation was 18 below zero at gunnison
for friday, sunny skies again were expected across most of the country, while snow was forecast across the great lakes region and scattered snowshowers over the central appalachians and northern maine. light rain was expected along the northern pacific coast, while clouds should increase across southern texas. much of the nation will have highs in the 40s or 50s. highs will be in the 20s and 30s from eastern north dakota across the great lakes region and the upper ohio valley to the northern two-thirds of the atlantic coast. temperatures will reach the 60s and 70s over the southern tier of states as well as over arkansas, oklahoma, kansas, western nebraska and parts of nevada, with readings in the 80s over portions of the desert southwest
albania said wednesday it was breaking out of its isolationist shell to build better relations with its neighbors, but bitter differences between turkey and bulgaria showed the region is still rife with disputes
albania's presence at a three-day conference of six balkan states was its first appearance at a regional forum after a decade of spurning invitations to attend low-level balkan gatherings
development of relations with neighboring countries constitutes one of the priorities of the foreign policy'' of albania, foreign minister reis malile told his counterparts from greece, turkey, yugoslavia, romania and bulgaria
not only do we not hesitate to cooperate with others. on the contrary, we want this cooperation and consider it a factor which contributes to our internal development,'' he said
but the conference, the first high-level gathering of balkan nations since world war ii, was marked by turkey's indirect denunciation of bulgaria's treatment of its turkish minority
attempts to alter the cultural and religious identity of ethnic minorities can neither be reconciled nor coexist with the new beginning we all seem desirous to make here in belgrade,'' said turkish foreign minister mesut yilmaz
relations among most balkan countries are still strained by bilateral quarrels over ethnic minorities that date back to the late 19th century when much of the region belonged to the ottoman empire
yilmaz did not assail bulgaria by name nor mention its estimated one million ethnic turks specifically, but the minority issue is the primary point of contention between the two countries
a campaign forcing turkish citizens to change their names was begun in 1984. it was first reported by turkish newspapers and later confirmed by western diplomats in sofia and by the human rights group, amnesty international
bulgarian authorities, who have so far denied the existence of a self-contained turkish minority, said the decision to adopt bulgarian names was voluntary and no pressure was exerted
the turkish foreign minister's comments were expected to be cause tension during the three-day meeting
he expressed his satisfaction about the ``common understanding'' he reached with his bulgrian counterpart peter mladenov in signing an agreement tuesday that he said would establish a mechanism for the settlement of the existing problems between the two countries
but yilmaz added that ``anachronistic policies cannot be either defended or ignored,'' a reference to bulgaria's policy toward the ethnic turks
asked to comment on yilmaz' speech, mladenov said he would comment on it only after reading it
a member of turkish delegation, asked why the turkish foreign minister decided to criticize bulgaria even after the protocol was signed, said: ``we are seeking a mechanism to solve our problem. but we have yet to see whether it will work.'' kentucky; picks up 5th graf pvs, bgng ``in louisville''</note>
jesse jackson mined for votes in eastern kentucky coal country thursday, the first democratic presidential candidate since 1968 to campaign in this area where he said the land is rich but the people are poor
jackson visited a strip mine site near hazard, then went to a rally that drew about 3,000 people
right down here in appalachia, the land is wealthy _ the people are poor,'' jackson told a crowd in the hazard memorial gymnasium
jackson, campaigning for support in kentucky's march 8 democratic presidential primary, said miners, farmers and factory workers must forge a coalition to battle abuses of large corporations which he said pay few taxes and hold down wages
jackson drew the most applause when he discussed coal-related issues. it is unfair, he said, when big coal companies pay almost no taxes. he also said: ``what good is land if it is stripped from beneath your feet?''
earlier, in louisville, jackson stressed his southern roots and his record. ``i return to the south as a son of the south,'' jackson said
i have given 25 years of national and international service,'' jackson said. ``my track record on national service is more substantial than my opponents. i know foreign policy better than my competitors.''
jackson, a baptist minister, addressed the 44th annual black baptist pastors' conference in louisville before flying to eastern kentucky
no other democratic presidential candidates have ventured into eastern kentucky this year _ or in any year since robert f. kennedy made a campaign trip to the kentucky mountains in 1968

in louisville, jackson said his southern credentials and campaign message will carry him through the super tuesday primary march 8
i return to the south as a son of the south,'' said jackson, who was born in south carolina. ``i helped make the new south better 25 years ago, and now i want to make it even better by focusing on the agenda of today.''
jackson said that agenda includes improving day care, attaining equal rights for women, increasing the minimum wage, increasing aid to education and stopping a loss of jobs
we must care about the family and working people,'' he said. ``we can't be a great nation if we abandon those whose shoulders we stand on.''
asked about his chances on super tuesday _ when democrats go to the primaries and caucuses in 20 states and american samoa _ and, in particular, about how he will do in the balloting in kentucky, jackson said:
i'm not projecting a certain number. those who support me feel i can win. i know i can win.''
jackson, who carried louisville and lexington in 1984 democratic caucuses, made a plug for campaign contributions in his address to the ministers
he later discounted claims that a lack of money will keep him from waging an effective campaign
i cannot buy the nomination. i will outwork my opposition,'' jackson said. ``i come to the south with a message and a track record, not money and television commercials.''
cbs and pat sajak insist they won't be gunning for nbc's ``the tonight show starring johnny carson'' when their new talk show premieres next january, despite its time period opposite the late-night king
cbs made a formal announcement of the signing of sajak, well-known as the host of ``wheel of fortune,'' at a news conference wednesday
cbs entertainment president kim lemasters said the show would be 90 minutes instead of carson's hour and would premiere on jan. 9, 1989
there is no attempt on our part here to compete with johnny carson,'' lemasters said. ``mr. carson is a tradition, he is much-beloved and a brilliant performer in what he does, and that's not our aim. our aim is that the environment in late night can stand more than just one talk-show format.''
if you're going to do a late-night show, that's a fact of life, that mr. carson is going to be there. we can't worry about that. we have to worry about doing the best show we can,'' said sajak
carson, who has been host of ``the tonight show'' for a quarter-century, last year signed only a two-year extension of his contract with nbc, but both sajak and lemasters said they did not plan on carson retiring
i have been hearing johnny carson is retiring for literally 20 years,'' said sajak. ``it wouldn't shock me to be having the same conversation in 10 years, that johnny carson is retiring in a couple of years.''
there's no name yet for the new show yet, though sajak joked, ``we're thinking of the wilton south show,'' a reference to the quickly canceled fox late-night show ``the wilton north report.'' he added, ``perhaps the name pat will be in the title.''
sajak will continue as host of the syndicated nighttime version of ``wheel of fortune,'' which is the no. 1 syndicated show. his contract for the nbc daytime version of the show expires in december
lemasters said cbs would have launched a talk show years ago ``if we'd had the personality.'' he said the network chose sajak because ``we were looking for someone intelligent, which pat is, well-read and with the ability to attract guests. and he's cute.''
lemasters said cbs might put its current schedule of late-night original dramas, ``adderly'' and ``night heat,'' in the 1 a.m. time period instead of canceling them
former secretary of state henry a. kissinger called on the european members of the nato alliance wednesday to unify their military defenses against the soviet union and to coordinate british and french nuclear forces as an important first step
kissinger also suggested that western europe and the united states present soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev with a comprehensive plan to reduce nuclear and conventional arms simultaneously
i am convinced that he has the intelligence and the imagination to make an intelligent response,'' kissinger told the senate armed services committee. ``and if he refused, we would at least understand the nature of the challenge better than we do now.''
kissinger said the western alliance will work better if europe sheds much of its military dependence on the united states and develops ``a capacity for independent action'' based on ``a rational balance of responsibilities.''
as it stands now, he said, the 16 european members of nato often go along with u.s. military decisions for lack of a better alternative. the result is not consultation or a mutual decision-making process but merely a u.s. ``briefing'' on already decided u.s. actions
under conditions of relative prosperity, kissinger said, europe's military dependence on the united states ``can breed guilt, self-hatred and a compulsion to display independence of the senior partner whenever doing so is safe, especially with regard to third world issues, the middle east and some aspects of east-west relations.''
for those reasons, he said, the united states has a positive interest in encouraging the evolution of a more independent european voice in defense matters
kissinger said that while some fear that military independence might weaken europe's military ties to the united states, ``the opposite is almost certainly the case.''
there is no foreseeable east-west conflict in which europe will not be better off with american support,'' kissinger said
this is why, if the british and the french can agree on coordinating their nuclear forces, the united states should encourage it as an important first step toward a greater european role in a joint nuclear defense,'' he said
above all, the united states should make clear that european union on defense matters will be viewed as strengthening, not weakening atlantic ties,'' he said
a european military union, he asserted, would ease west germany's fears of isolation and help overcome a ``logistical nightmare'' caused by the effort of each european nation to ``stretch already inadequate defense efforts across the whole panoply of weapons.''
kissinger said that divisive trends within the alliance have been magnified by the successful ratification of the new treaty eliminating medium-range u.s. and soviet nuclear-armed missiles in europe and elsewhere
he repeated recent statements that the treaty strains the alliance by making the nuclear defense of europe dependent largely on nuclear weapons located not in europe but in the united states or on submarines at sea
many europeans are convinced a gap is being created that in time will enable the soviet union to threaten europe while sparring with the united states,'' he said
here are excerpts of the government's new regulations banning political activity by major opposition groups:
if the minister (of law and order) is of the opinion that it is necessary for the safety of the public, the maintenance of public order or the termination of the state of emergency, he may, without prior notice to any person or without hearing any person, issue an order ... prohibiting an organization ... from carrying on:
_ any activities or acts whatsoever
_ activities or acts of a nature, class or kind specified in the order
the order said an affected organization will not be barred from:
_ preserving its assets
_ keeping up to date its books and records and performing administrative functions in connection therewith
_ complying with an obligation imposed on it by or under any law or court
_ taking legal advice or judicial steps
_ carrying on such activities or performing such acts as the minister may have consented to
no consent ... shall be granted by the minister unless he is convinced that the granting of such consent will not result in the safety of the public or the maintenance of public order being threatened
the order listed the following organizations as being affected by the new restrictions:
azanian people's organization
azanian youth organization
cape youth congress
cradock residents association
detainees parents support committee
detainees support committee
national education crisis committee
national education union of south africa

more than 100 ungraded results from an upper-level law exam were accidentally shredded, leaving washington university officials with red faces and some students furious
it seemed to be just a matter of time before a huge administrative error occurred,'' maia brodie, a third-year law student and president of the student bar association, said of the shredding, which was revealed last week. ``some students want their money back, they're so furious.''
school officials said a student working without supervision in the registrar's office accidentally shredded both the questions and answers to a three-hour exam that was given in december
the exam was to provide the sole basis for the grades of 116 students who were enrolled in the evidence course
the shredding occurred two weeks ago. law school dean dorsey d. ellis jr. gave the bad news to the class in a memorandum dated feb. 16
school officials decided to give each student in the evidence class a ``credit'' that will have no bearing on grade-point averages
one student studied nearly full-time for five weeks in hopes of raising her grade-point average through the exam, she said. moreover, minor differences in grade averages can ``make the difference between a $26,000 job and a $40,000 job,'' brodie said. bgng: give us; editing in 11th pvs, bgng: senate majority</note>
a weary senate ended 53 hours of continuous and sometimes cantankerous debate over campaign finance thursday, leaving democrats no closer to victory than when the filibuster began tuesday
by agreement between majority democrats and stubborn republicans, the talking stopped about 7 p.m., setting up a friday vote on a democratic cloture motion to force a vote on their campaign legislation
democrats have the votes to pass the bill, but they had virtually no hope of mustering the 60 needed to win friday's cloture roll call. the expected loss could scuttle the divisive issue for the 100th congress
as the filibuster wound down, majority leader robert byrd, d-w.va., made a final pitch for voluntary spending limits to counter the escalating cost of getting elected, with increasing amounts of money coming from special-interest political action committees
the senate should not be owned by an aristocracy of money,'' byrd said. ``campaign reform gives the little guy an equal share. ... this business of the golden handshake _ nobody likes it. senators don't want to spend all their time going from fundraiser to fundraiser with their hand out begging for money.''
another advocate of spending limits, sen. david boren, d-okla., conceded that ``negotiations have fallen apart'' because of gop opposition to proposed voluntary spending limits on senate campaigns
give us a chance!'' boren shouted, urging his republican foes to join in shutting off debate and allowing a floor vote on the campaign finance measure, which democrats have the votes to win
boren promised that if gop senators switched sides and provided the winning margin to invoke cloture, the democratic bill would be open to all ``legitimate, relevant'' amendments the republicans might propose to reach a compromise
but gop senators made clear their fears that the spending limits proposal disguises an attempt to reinforce the democrats' election advantage in large, heavily democratic states and to perpetuate their majority control of the senate
sen. warren rudman, r-n.h., called it the ``incumbent protection act'' and said it would work against election challengers with little name recognition or financial support
everyone in politics knows that with these (spending) limits, what we absolutely say to most challengers is, `you've had it,''' rudman said
we've heard a lot of accusations on this floor that this bill is designed to end the republican party,'' rudman said. ``i don't believe that ... but to many of us on this side of the aisle it kind of feels that way.''
the senate will vote at 10 a.m. friday on whether to invoke cloture, or halt further debate on the bill
the measure has 52 co-sponsors, more than the majority of 51 senators necessary for passage, but democratic strategists say they are still short of the 60 votes required to invoke cloture and proceed to a floor vote on the bill itself
byrd lost a record seven cloture votes on the bill last year, and the lack of any significant weakening in gop determination to block the measure made it likely that byrd would lose again friday morning
he hasn't said what would happen to the bill after the expected cloture defeat, but democratic aides said privately that it would be shelved
byrd, who once threatened to continue round-the-clock filibustering through next week, relented wednesday night and announced agreement with the gop leadership to end the talkathon late thursday afternoon
byrd spokeswoman linda peek denied that the agreement represented a democratic defeat. ``the defeat is for the republicans who are consistently against the campaign spending limits and are afraid to vote on the bill,'' she said
the measure calls for voluntary ceilings on senate campaign spending that range from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a state's population. participating candidates would be eligible for treasury funds if their opponents exceed the limits or if independent groups spend large amounts against a candidate observing the restriction
the bill also would prohibit a participating candidate from receiving more than 20 percent of campaign funds from special-interest political action committees. in 1986, more than 200 house and senate candidates _ most of them incumbents _ received more than half their campaign money from pacs
republicans argued that spiraling campaign costs, rather than spending, should be the primary issue
sen. ted stevens, r-alaska, said the only compromise he would accept would be to allow candidates in individual states to agree on their own spending limts. rudman argued for reallocating contributions under a formula that would allow 50 percent to come from individuals, 30 percent from the political parties and 20 percent from pacs
the debate thursday was much calmer than the day before, when republicans angrily denounced byrd's successful motion to have the senate sergeant-at-arms, henry k. giugni, arrest absentee republicans and force them to return to the chamber
under giugni's direction, armed plainclothes capitol police broke into the locked offices of sen. bob packwood, r-ore., and carried him feet-first onto the senate floor. packwood's arrival provided the 51st senator necessary to constitute a quorum or majority of senators on the floor
byrd hoped to embarrass the republicans by focusing attention on their stalling tactics, and without a quorum to keep the filibuster alive, the senate would have been forced to adjourn
before he arrested packwood, giugni reportedly approached sen. lowell p. weicker jr., r-conn., in the russell senate office building. but weicker, a large man known for his hot temper, refused to submit and giugni left without a protest
afghanistan's communist government said thursday a guerrilla proposal for an interim government while soviet troops withdraw was a ``hysterical'' dream, but a u.s. envoy called it a good idea
undersecretary of state michael armacost, visiting pakistan, said the plan announced this week by the seven-party guerrilla alliance was a ``very welcome step toward the resolution of the afghan problem.''
the alliance, led by yunis khalis and based in pakistan, proposes an executive council of all seven guerrilla leaders to preside over a 28-member cabinet of rebels, afghan refugees and ``moslems presently living in kabul.''
soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an estimated 115,000 now are in the country helping fight the guerrillas
about 3.5 million afghans have fled to neighboring pakistan. most live in border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas
thursday's editions of the afghan communist party newspaper anis said the plan ``resembles more a hysterical and disturbed dream,'' kabul radio reported
it is clear that this void and unfounded plan has no legitimacy and therefore is unacceptable,'' the paper said, adding that the insurgent proposal was like the ``story of sharing the wolf's prey.''
the radio also broadcast a foreign ministry statement that ``there is only one legal government in afghanistan, which has been recognized by 80 countries in the world.''
armacost arrived wednesday to discuss progress toward soviet withdrawal. he met with president mohammed zia ul-haq, and a u.s. embassy official said he also had ``frank and open'' discussions with leaders of the moslem guerrillas
mikhail s. gorbachev said feb. 8 that soviet troops will start pulling out may 15 if u.n.-sponsored talks in geneva between afghanistan and pakistan bring a settlement by march 15, and complete the withdrawal in 10 months. the talks are to resume wednesday
pakistan demands a military settlement be accompanied by a political one to ensure transitional stability. washington, which supports the guerrillas, has devoted most of its effort to obtaining a withdrawal
a doctor with aids once ordered to stay away from patients at cook county hospital was guaranteed full medical duties under an agreement approved wednesday by a federal judge
the consent decree signed by u.s. district judge john a. nordberg ensures that the neurologist will be able to examine patients, draw blood, perform spinal taps and handle other procedures included in his speciality
the cook county board restored most of those duties last september after the doctor filed a lawsuit, but nordberg had suggested the board could again reverse itself and asked for a formal agreement between the doctor and hospital
a year ago, the board, which governs the hospital, barred any contact between patients and the doctor
in july, the board said the doctor could see patients, but could not puncture the skin or come in contact with body fluids of patients
the american civil liberties union, acting on behalf of the doctor, filed a lawsuit a month later seeking the return of full medical responsibilities for him
we're all gratified that the cook county hospital has agreed to follow medical evidence that a doctor with aids can continue to practice,'' said aclu attorney ben wolf of the agreement worked out between the aclu, the hospital and the board
he will follow centers for disease control guidelines, which require gloves when certain procedures are performed,'' wolf said. ``he has even agreed to wear double gloves in certain instances.''
wolf said complications from aids have caused the doctor to miss some days of work
when his health permits, he's practicing. he's had some tough times,'' the attorney said
a spokeswoman for the hospital, wanda robertson, forwarded all calls to hospital director terrence m. hansen, who did not return messages requesting comment
under the decree, the doctor is not required to tell patients he has aids, wolf said
the decree said the doctor would not perform muscle biopsies or cerebral work, but not because he has the fatal disease. neurologists have not handled those procedures in years, wolf said
aids, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers
the virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth
nasa chief james fletcher said wednesday that the civil space program is the key to questions ``about where this civilization is going'' and should not be allowed to suffer from the shortsightedness of ``naysayers.''
we need to adopt a rigorous space agenda beyond the 1990s and stick to it,'' fletcher said in a speech before the national space club
he said american technological leadership will ride on the consistent and longterm national support for the space policy recently announced by president reagan
the stakes are very high,'' fletcher said. ``the soviets have let it be known that they are in space to stay. .... leadership (in space) is not just who is ahead, but is a sustained and consistent effort toward goals over a long period of time.''
he said reagan's space policy affirms the nation's commitment to the space station and to human exploration beyond earth orbit, such as to mars. the policy is supported in the president's budget presented last week to congress
the program presented to congress is the right policy at the right time,'' fletcher said. ``we now need to rally national support to it through the various congressional hurdles.''
the civil space program is key to the much larger questions about where this civilization is going,'' he said. ``we can't let the program founder through shortsightedness.''
the nasa administrator cautioned that some oppose the space program and that public support is needed to overcome these objections
it's surprising how many naysayers there are in and out of congress,'' he said. ``we have to guard against the naysayers.''
the national space club is an organization of industrial, military, congressional and governmental supporters of the u.s. efforts in space and rocketry. word `disputed,' subs 6th graf pvs: `a member ... to insert word `non-voting</note>
armenians demanding annexation of part of a neighboring republic massed by the thousands in two cities thursday, and red army troops and tanks were sent into one area as a show of force, witnesses said
a senior official was quoted as saying there were ``human victims'' of the unrest
demonstrations in the armenian capital of yerevan appeared to be the largest unsanctioned gatherings in soviet history, according to eyewitness accounts. some witnesses said more than 1 million people participated in protests and strikes. there was no official estimate of the numbers
the demonstrators were demanding that the nagorno-karabakh region, now part of the republic of azerbaidzhan, be annexed to armenia
in addition to the territorial dispute involving the 1,760-square-mile autonomous region in the caucusus mountains, the people are divided by religion. armenians are predominantly christians, and most azeris, the dominant ethnic group in azerbaidzhan, are shiite moslem
a non-voting member of the ruling politburo, vladimir i. dolgikh, said in a television broadcast wednesday night from yerevan that there were ``human victims'' of the unrest, according to an armenian telephone operator in yerevan
the operator said dolgikh did not provide details
an armenian nationalist activist said he heard rumors that azeris had stoned a bus in nagorno-karabakh, killing an undetermined number of armenians. the activist, mofses gorgisyan, said he also heard that azeris set fire to a school, resulting in other deaths
in glendale, calif., apo boghigian, editor of the armenian newspaper asbarez, said he spoke by telephone wednesday to hovig vassilian, a newspaper editor in yerevan. boghigian said vassilian described the demonstrators in yerevan as ``very peaceful'' but said clashes elsewhere had resulted in deaths
four victims were to be buried thursday in askeran, an armenian village of about 1,000 people, boghigian said
in nagorno-karabakh's main city, sepanakert, about 120,000 people have demonstrated daily since feb. 13, said one resident
the 17-year-old student, interviewed in a moscow airport after arriving from armenia, said some armenians had been killed by azeris in the region, but she had no details
the official tass news agency said a deputy prosecutor from the central government was sent to azerbaidzhan, indicating serious concern over the unrest
tass quoted the prosecutor, alexander katusev, as saying: ``all sorts of rumors and inventions that are being circulated mostly outside of the nagorno-karabakh autnomous region and for which gullible people often fall are groundless.''
he acknowledged, however, that crimes were committed and promised to investigate
there was no way to verify the reports independently because the government barred foreign reporters from traveling to the area
gorgisyan, interviewed by telephone, estimated there were more than 1 million demonstrators in yerevan. a telephone operator said that figure seemed accurate
soldiers arrived thursday morning and took up discreet positions in downtown yerevan, particularly around key government buildings, gorgisyan said. they deployed camouflaged trucks downtown and stationed tanks in outlying areas, said gorgisyan, a 26-year-old member of an underground group called the alliance for national determination
the soldiers did not try to stop the demonstration, and gorgisyan said the protesters were trying not to provoke the troops
we're trying not to break any laws. the demonstration is very well organized and orderly,'' he said
he said businesses and schools were closed in the city and in many other parts of the armenian republic, the smallest of the soviet union's 15 republics and home to 3.4 million soviets
in nagorno-karabakh, the student said she saw a large crowd of demonstrators thursday in lenin square in stepanakert
practically the whole population is there. they've come from all the villages,'' said the student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
the protests were continuing around the clock. ``no one's sleeping. no one is going to work. the only stores open are groceries,'' she said
an official at the armenian representational offices in moscow in charge of internal matters, rudolf khatchyanov, confirmed a major demonstration by armenians was going on. he said to call authorities in yerevan for more details, but telephone calls to police in yerevan did not go through
the communist party's national central committee this month decided nagorno-karabakh should remain part of azerbaidzhan. radio moscow said armenian authorities planned to ask the central committee to reconsider its position
the demonstrations in the region began after the party's decision was announced, ayrikyan said
tass announced wednesday night that an armenian, genrikh pogosyan, had been named party leader in the disputed region. he replaced boris kevorkov, who also is armenian
prosecutors said thursday it may take up to a month to decide whether to file charges in the death of a woman whose head was cut off and frozen in hopes of bringing her back to life someday in a new body
the riverside county coroner's office this week ruled the death of 83-year-old dora kent a homicide caused by a lethal dose of barbiturates. she died in december at the alcor life extension foundation cryonics laboratory
assistant district attorney jay thompson hanks said the decision to bring charges could take up to a month ``only because there are other questions to be asked and answered, and other pieces of evidence we want tested or examined.''
thompson said ``a wide range of charges'' is being contemplated. those under investigation include ``everyone associated with the death,'' he said
mrs. kent's son, saul kent, 48, is a supporter of the cryonics movement, which freezes bodies or heads in the belief that science will advance to the point where they can be brought back to life
on dec. 9, mrs. kent's physician determined she was gravely ill. her son then removed her from a riverside nursing home and brought her to alcor
kent says his mother was maintained there briefly on a respirator before dying dec. 11. her head was surgically removed
the coroner's office investigated because no doctor was present when mrs. kent died
the coroner asked to examine the head, but kent has refused to give it location. a judge blocked the coroner from disturbing any of the frozen remains at alcor
mrs. kent's son said barbiturates are used after death to slow brain damage caused by lack of oxygen. but the coroner's investigation concluded that mrs. kent was alive when drugs were administered
reagan administration officials were led to believe they had to keep dealing with iran or american hostages could be killed, former white house chief of staff donald t. regan said in a deposition released thursday
regan's account of the arms-for-hostages program was revealed in depositions taken last summer by the congressional iran-contra committees
regan said that at first he supported the idea of allowing israel to sell u.s.-made weapons to iran in september 1985 in return for freeing american hostages held by pro-iranian terrorists in lebanon
i thought it was worth pursuing,'' regan said of the initiative. ``it was an opening. i thought we should explore it.''
by december, regan said he had changed his mind. another shipment of weapons was sent to iran in november, but only one hostage _ the rev. benjamin weir _ was freed in the fall of 1985
asked why, regan said: ``well, the thing had been a fiasco up to that point, in my judgment it had not worked. we were dealing with some very unusual people
we were fooling around for the better part of six months with very little results to show for it, and i couldn't see the value of pursuing that avenue any more. i thought we were dealing either with the wrong people or in the wrong way.''
but regan said john m. poindexter, the former national security adviser, convinced him to go along with the more shipments. poindexter told president reagan and regan that ``there was a whole new lead and a whole new plan and that it might turn thing around.''
in addition, regan said the president, vice president george bush and poindexter received some unsettling news from robert f. mcfarlane, who had been poindexter's predecessor at the national security council
mcfarlane, who continued to work on the hostage project after his resignation from the nsc, traveled to london in december to meet manucher ghorbanifar, a middleman in the u.s.-iran relationship
regan was asked whether on his return mcfarlane indicated that if discussions with the iranians were terminated, the hostages could be killed
yes,'' replied the former chief of staff
this was becoming increasingly evident, that unless we got on a new tack, we would (a) probably never see our hostages; or (b) the whole project would end in dismal failure,'' regan said
in january 1986, the united states began shipping weapons directly to iran. the project ended in november after revelations that profits from the sale of weapons to iran had been diverted to the nicaraguan contras. nine americans remain hostage in lebanon
when majority leader robert byrd forced the senate into its night-and-day campaign spending filibuster on tuesday, he said he wanted to expose republican stalling tactics to the american public
the public got a show, but it was not quite the one the west virginia democrat was looking for
overshadowing the lesson in how a senate minority can use the debate rules to thwart the will of the majority was a late-night cops-and-robbers show produced by the democrats
the climax came early wednesday when a plainclothes police posse led by sergeant-at-arms henry giugni, acting on orders from democrats, pushed through the office door of sen. bob packwood, r-ore., arrested him and carried him feet first into the senate chamber
packwood's commanded performance gave byrd the quorum he needed to keep the filibuster going. it also gave angry republicans a rallying point to shift the focus away from their refusal to let the senate vote on a democratic bill with 52 co-sponsors from the 100-member chamber
illegal, unlawful, null and void,'' snarled arlen specter, r-pa
the former philadelphia district attorney said packwood's apprehension ``really constituted false arrest of a u.s. senator. ... there is a sense that the senate is falling apart, that the senate is disintegrating.''
specter complained that his colleague was treated like a ``common criminal,'' subjected to police-state measures appropriate to ``nazi germany and communist russia.''
banana republic,'' snapped orrin hatch, r-utah. ``the tyranny of the majority,'' said acting minority leader alan simpson, r-wyo. ``demeaning and humiliating,'' was the verdict of malcolm wallop, r-wyo
democrats responded that packwood _ and other absent republicans who escaped the posse's clutches _ had it coming
after all, they said, democrats were only forcing the gop to do something that voters sent them to washington to do: answer the bell and vote
in the span of 45 minutes, the entire republican party in the united states senate, with the exception of one, the designated (floor) leader, vanished into the night,'' said sen. john kerry, d-mass
like most filibusters, this one was a game of chicken. which side would cave in? would the senate compromise over the central question of setting spending limits for senate races?
democrats insist that limits are crucial to any legislation to curb the escalating cost of getting elected
but republican leaders held fast that limits were not negotiable
after vowing to keep the senate in continuous session at least through the end of next week, byrd agreed late wednesday to bring the filibuster to a close at 5 p.m. thursday, get a night's sleep and vote friday on a democratic motion to shut off debate and bring the bill to a vote. it finally ended at 7 p.m., two hours past the original target
byrd will probably lose that cloture vote, just as he lost a record seven cloture votes last year, never getting closer than 55 of the 60 votes needed to end the debate that has consumed 30 days since last june
republicans, outnumbered 54 to 46, have made opposition to spending limits a party issue. so far, only three gop senators have broken ranks and supported cloture: bill co-sponsors robert stafford of vermont and john chafee of rhode island and non-sponsor nancy landon kassebaum of kansas
one key to the eventual outcome is a handful of other republicans who are known to support some form of spending limits but who thus far have stayed loyal to their party's line
democrats had hoped to pick up support for cloture before they had to concede defeat and pull the bill from the floor. the necessary crossovers never materialized, leaving campaign finance a very sick, if not dead, issue for the 100th congress

if panamanian strongman gen. manuel antonio noriega left panama because of attempts to oust him from power, ``we would attempt to extradite him like any other dope dealer,'' a federal prosecutor said thursday
there is no consideration whatsoever to dropping this indictment,'' said richard gregorie, chief assistant u.s. attorney in florida's southern district. ``i have not been asked by anybody to do that.''
noriega was indicted in miami with 15 others feb. 4 on charges of taking at least $4.6 million to protect shipments of colombian cocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drug kingpins. also charged were medellin drug cartel leader pablo escobar gaviria and a top noriega aide, capt. luis del cid
gregorie, the lead prosecutor in the noriega drug case, said panamanian president eric arturo delvalle made a ``pretty gutsy move'' thursday in ordering noriega out of his post and named a replacement
assuming he does step down, he's going to be like any other citizen,'' gregorie said, ``and i would assume there might be a great likelihood that he would leave the country and go somewhere where we'd have a chance of getting him.''
in tampa, a grand jury feb. 5 indicted noriega and panamanian businessman enrique pretelt on marijuana conspiracy and importation charges
a 1904 treaty between the united states and panama does not oblige either state to extradite its own citizens
the indictment alleged that noriega allied himself with the medellin cartel and once enlisted the help of cuban leader fidel castro to mediate a dispute with the cartel over drug money
castro said in an interview with nbc news aired thursday that jose blandon, former panamanian consul general in new york, lied about castro's role as a mediator for noriega. castro was named in the indictment, but not charged
u.s. attorney leon kellner charged at the time of the indictment that noriega used his position of power in panama to ``sell the country of panama to drug traffickers.''
if noriega is ever brought to trial and convicted of all charges, he could face up to 145 years in prison and fines of more than $1.1 million, prosecutors say
a defendant in the miami indictment, brian alden davidow, 26, of miami surrendered to authorities and pleaded innocent a week ago
ambler moss, former u.s. ambassador to panama, said thursday that delvalle's move was unlikely to bring noriega to trial
it's highly unusual because the military in panama has dominated politics there for a very long time,'' said moss, ambassasor from 1978 to 1982. ``it's very unusual that he would even dare try to separate the head of the armed forces from his powers
it's a very courageous act, although we don't know whether some deal was worked out in advance,'' he said. ``i doubt this would ever result in his standing trial in the united states.''
gregorie held a glimmer of hope. ``if mr. noriega chooses to come here tomorrow morning to be arraigned, he will receive discovery immediately,'' he said, ``and we will be prepared to go to trial in 60 days.''
in a major reassessment of nikita khrushchev, a prominent writer has said the former soviet leader deserves praise for ending stalin's cult of personality and introducing economic reforms
the article was the most wide-ranging appraisal of khrushchev in the official media to date
fedor burlatsky said khrushchev should be praised for putting an end to the cult of personality that surrounded his predecessor, josef stalin, and for improving the economy and bringing modern technology to the country
burlatsky also believes, however, that khrushchev did a bad job of managing the vast soviet bureaucracy and was not completely candid about the nation's problems
now that we are guided by the experience of glasnost, we can see clearly how little was done to inform people about the past, about real problems, about planned decisions,'' burlatsky wrote in an article published wednesday in the literary gazette newspaper
khruschev ruled in 1953-1964 and declared that the soviet union would bury the west, but he was later removed from the leadership in disgrace
soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev has encouraged a review of history in his campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness in some matters
numerous articles have appeared about stalin and his excesses but burlatsky is the first to take a detailed look at khrushchev. the journalist and playwright, who was an aide to khrushchev, said the former leader's name was taboo for nearly 20 years until gorbachev mentioned him nov. 2
a wind of change swept the country, the people's spirits rose, they took heart, became bolder and more confident,'' gorbachev said, and praised khrushchev for ridding the country of stalin's cult of personality
burlatsky, 61, picked up that theme in his full-page article
the main significance khrushchev gave to the ideological side of matters was ... unmasking the cult of personality, to speak out the truth about the crimes of the 30s and other periods,'' he wrote
he praised khrushchev for such technological achievements as putting the first man in space and reviving soviet agriculture
khrushchev was not candid in revealing his actions under stalin, however, because ``many in the party knew about the role that he played in persecuting'' people, burlatsky wrote
he also faulted khrushchev for using ``traditional administrative and even bureaucratic methods'' that ruined what began as bold reforms in agriculture and the overall economy
khrushchev was ousted from the leadership in october 1964 by a ``strange symbiosis of political forces'' ranging from conservatives and stalinists to reform-minded officials, burlatsky said
after the fall, khrushchev sank into obscurity. he died in 1971 and the government of leonid i. brezhnev ordered that he be buried in moscow's novodevichy cemetery, second in importance to the kremlin wall
rumors have been circulating that his remains might be moved to the kremlin, where the nation's other top leaders are buried
in a telephone conversation from his newspaper office thursday night, burlatsky said he had not heard any proposals for moving the body
maybe some informal group is talking about it, but it's certainly not a firm proposal among party members,'' said burlatsky, who is a member of the communist party
basque separatists appear to have broken a 60-day truce they offered the government by kidnapping 58-year-old businessman emiliano revilla sanza, officials said thursday
deputy prime minister alfonso guerra told reporters the government considers the kidnapping an attack by the basque separatist organization eta and will not pursue contacts begun with the organization ``because we don't talk with terrorists.''
rafael vazquez, a spokesman for the revilla family, said there had been no contact with armed kidnappers who seized revilla at 11:30 p.m. wednesday outside his home in central madrid. he said the family did not know the identity of the three men and a woman witnesses saw forcing revilla into a car
the kidnapping of the well-known madrid real estate developer occurred after reports that the government had resumed contacts over the weekend with eta members in exile in algeria
eta, whose initials stand for basque land and liberty in the basque language, has taken responsibility for killing more than 600 people in a 20-year campaign for independence in spain's three northern basque provinces
during his annual address to parliament on wednesday, prime minister felipe gonzalez said spaniards should not lower their guard against terrorism despite optimism created by reports of contacts between the government and eta
gonzalez said his government had agreed to resume talks only if the organization respected a 60-day truce offer it made jan. 28
the government broke off preliminary talks with eta in algiers after the group claimed responsibility for the dec. 11 car bombing of a zaragoza civil guard barracks in which 11 people were killed
since 1977, eta has kidnapped 63 people, most of them basque businessmen, to raise funds for its operations. news conference to wednesday; picks up 11th graf pvs bgng, `if anyone'</note>
the u.s. economy expanded at a 4.5 percent annual rate from october through december, the fastest pace in almost two years, the government reported thursday
the growth in the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's health, was revised up from an original estimate of 4.2 percent made a month ago
the reagan administration said the growth rate showed the economic recovery, now in its sixth year, a record for peacetime, was suffering no ill effects from the october stock market collapse. however, private economists said they were still concerned about the lopsided nature of the growth
the rapid expansion in the fourth quarter occured without a pickup in inflation. a price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 3.7 percent from october through december, little changed from a 3.4 percent increase in the third quarter
three-fourths of the growth last quarter came from a buildup of business inventories which was occurring at the same time that consumer spending was plunging 3.1 percent, the biggest spending drop in more than seven years
the last such sharp drop in consumer spending occurred in 1980 during the brief recession that year which helped doom president jimmy carter's re-election bid
many economists believe that growth will slow substantially in the first half of this presidential election year, but in what could be good news for republican chances to hold onto the white house, they are not forecasting an outright recession
some analysts said the revisions made in the new gnp report made them more confident that a recession can be avoided
as we move into 1988, there has to be a slowdown to work off excessive retail inventories, but it will be a pause and not a recession,'' said allen sinai, chief economixq
released, hinted at his press conference wednesday night that the figure would be a good one and he attacked democratic presidential candidates for misrepresenting his administration's economic achievements
if anyone listened for more than 15 minutes to their candidates, you would decide that we're burdened by inflation, high interest rates and unemployment, when at the moment none of those things are true,'' reagan said
analysts said they were encouraged by the new gnp report because it showed that consumer spending, while falling sharply, was not as weak as previously believed. the report also increased the estimate of business investment spending, another area of expected strength in the new year
the economy is better than most people think. consumers are not fizzling out,'' sinai said
on the basis of the revised gnp figures, sinai said he had boosted his estimate of growth in the current quarter to between 1 percent and 2 percent, up from an earlier prediction that growth could be as low as 0.5 percent in the first three months of this year
james cochran, an economist with texas commerce bancshares of houston, said that the new gnp report ``confirms that we will have positive growth in the first quarter. it won't be fantastic, but it will be positive.''
some economists had been so concerned that the huge buildup in inventories would force widespread factory layoffs, that they were predicting possibly one quarter of negative gnp growth. a traditional recession is defined as two consecutive quarters in which the gnp declines
the 4.5 percent increase in economic growth followed a gain of 4.3 percent in the third quarter and was the fastest advance since a 5.4 percent rise in the first quarter of 1986
the fourth-quarter gain boosted growth for the year to 3.9 percent, when measured from the end of 1986, up slightly from the 3.8 percent estimate made a month ago. growth when all four quarters of the year are averaged together showed a 2.9 percent increase in 1987, the same as 1986
the reagan administration is forecasting that growth this year will slow to a rate of 2.4 percent. many private economists believe even this scaled-down figure is too optimistic given the huge overhang of inventories that will slow production in the early part of the year
the administration believes the country will get half of its growth this year from an improving trade deficit as american manufacturers continue to benefit from the decline in the value of the dollar
that trend was evident in the fourth quarter as the country's trade deficit, after adjusting for inflation, shrank by $2 billion as exports shot up by 15.1 percent, outpacing a 9.7 percent rise in imports
the various changes added $42 billion to the total gnp in the fourth quarter, leaving it at an inflation-adjusted $3.88 trillion
here is the text of president eric arturo delvalle's nationally broadcast message ordering gen. manuel antonio noriega removed from his post as military chief, as translated from spanish by the associated press:
panama currently is experiencing one of the most difficult and dangerous moments of its history. it really is lamentable that after having achieved in a few years, with international help and support, success in the struggle for its sovereignty, and after having begun a transition toward a promised democracy and even more recently having started its stalled economy, today the country finds itself virtually at siege economically by external pressures and tensions, in its international prestige as a nation
what has been able to take us to such a terrible crossroads in such a short time?
certainly a dose of unawareness from many, exaggerated ambitions from some and a great lack of understanding from others have contributed decisively to placing us in such a severe as well as critical situation
i should confess with honor that in my unchangeable desire to achieve my goal i have been able to commit some mistakes, but it is even worse to be a victim as i have been of so many misunderstandings without allowing that they might change my way of acting, as i am doing with deep love for my country
i must consider with sadness that many of the successes that have been obtained have been vanishing in the past eight months
this has converted my concerns into fruitless yearnings
what is certain is that the mistaken positions, the unconsulted actions and the mistakes committed, now or in the past, have led to acts of extreme significance, such as those that represent the noticeable paralysis, the rhythm of social and economic development that we have experienced since the midway point of last year
the pressures and tensions of which we are an object and the serious accusations of the grand jury of florida against noriega, accusations which have been gathered and spread by the international press, have damaged the image and prestige of panama
these actions which u.s. officials have taken on the basis that the country is not moving toward a true democracy and the accusations against noriega, are starting to be reflected in an unfavorable international attitude toward the panamanian nation that is financial as well as diplomatic
that situation places the republic before a very serious risk in which the present and future well being of the panamanian people is found at risk
facing this enormous responsibility as a leader, several days ago i decided that i should suggest, and that's what i did, to gen. noriega that he voluntarily step aside from his high command until the charges that had been raised against him might be investigated, and that would reflect highly on his own good and the health and tranquility of the republic
i have not had evidence that the healthy purposes that motivated my suggestion in the sense expressed have had any impact whatsoever. i decided that it was prudent to wait some days so that he might have sufficient time to meditate on the seriousness of the situation to which he is exposing himself and to which he is submitting the country
for all that might be deduced that the accusations against gen. noriega have a political nature, the internal situation of panama cannot be ignored. each day it becomes more complex and dangerous and there will not be peace nor liberty nor progress in panama nor will be be able to perfect or consolidate our democratic system, unless we overcome the passions that have been unleashed and we clarify the deeds beyond all doubt
to find solutions to the serious crisis that affects institutional life and economic stability, it is indispensable that as soon as possible the country might return to the climate of peace and tranquility
the reasons that might take us to fiscal and economic imbalance and that might push thousands of panamanians to unemployment, misery and despair cannot persist
the causes for which the international credit agencies and the international banking community, which always have collaborated with us, might turn their backs to us, worsening our already weakened and precarious situation, cannot persist
the attitudes and conduct that might justify friendly nations to adopt positions that isolate our country and reduce the prestige of our nation cannot persist
we cannot persist in incubating our own disaster, whatever might be the motive, reason or justification that any entity, group or person might brandish, because nothing or no one comes above the nation.''
a mistrial was declared thursday after a jury deadlocked in the case of a former california highway patrol officer accused of murdering a motorist he had pulled over at an isolated freeway exit in 1986
it does not seem to me that any further deliberation is likely to produce a verdict,'' superior court judge richard huffman after seven days of deliberation in the case against 37-year-old craig peyer of poway
peyer was accused of strangling cara knott, a 20-year-old san diego state university student. the 13-year chp veteran was the second officer in the agency's 58-year history to be charged with killing a motorist while on duty
jury forewoman walnetta lenhardt said that after three ballots, jurors deadlocked 7-5 in favor of conviction
i have always thought he was innocent. it's in god's hands. it always will be,'' peyer's wife, karen, said outside court
steve casey, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said no decision had been made on whether to retry the case against peyer
we're tough. we'll do it for cara. we're going to see it through for cara,'' said a tearful joyce knott, the victim's mother
peyer has been free on $1 million bail throughout the trial. first-degree murder carries a sentence of 25 years to life in prison
peyer was fired by the highway patrol in may after an internal investigation
the prosecution in the trial that began jan. 19 alleged that peyer, patrolling interstate 15, stopped knott because of a defective tail light and forced her to drive down a dark, isolated offramp
knott's white volkswagen was found abandoned in a cul-de-sac near the bottom of an exit, and her body was found at the bottom of a nearby 65-foot highway bridge
twenty-two women had testified during the trial that peyer pulled them over on i-15 and directed them down the same isolated ramp. state officials closed the ramp for safety reasons soon after knott's killing
prosecutors presented blood and fiber evidence that they said linked peyer to the victim, as well as two surprise witnesses who said they saw a chp unit pull over a light-colored volkswagen on i-15 the night knott was slain
the defense argued the blood and fiber evidence was flimsy and unreliable and accused the two witnesses of lying, noting both had waited a year before coming forward with their stories. with comment from governor's spokesman on effect of vote and cubs statement about installation of lights.</note>
the city council voted thursday to lift a ban on night games at the only major-league ballpark without lights, signaling a likely end to a 72-year-tradition of daytime-only baseball at wrigley field
the vote was 29-19 in favor of lights
the tribune co., owner of the chicago cubs, has threatened to move the team out of chicago if lights aren't allowed at the venerable, ivy-covered ballpark
a state law limiting noise at night effectively banned night games at wrigley. the law was suspended last year for post-season nighttime play, and similar action may be needed to allow regular-season night games, some officials said thursday
alderman bobby rush, chairman of the committee that held hearings on the city ordinance, said state legislators have agreed to follow the city in rolling back the ban
they may have to make some adjustments, but there won't be any snags,'' he said. ``the cubs will probably proceed with lights as soon as weather permits.''
jim bray, a spokesman for gov. james r. thompson, said the effect of the council vote was uncertain
there's always been a question whether the original legislation ever would have been able to prevent night games if the cubs wanted to and did install lights,'' bray said
the cubs said after the vote that the club would install a $5 million lighting system that should be ready in four to six months
the proposal approved by the council and endorsed by mayor eugene sawyer would allow eight night games this season and 18 each of the following years until 2002 at the ballpark
at the team's mesa, ariz., training camp, pitcher rick sutcliffe said, ``i think the night games will give us a chance to rest up during the day after coming off long road trips
a lot of times we don't get home from road trips till 2 or 3 in the morning, and only get about four hours of sleep before heading back out to the ballpark,'' he said
wrigley field, a neighborhood landmark since 1914, is bordered by small apartment houses where residents can sit on the roof and watch the action for free. many residents of ``wrigleyville'' are vehemently opposed to night games, anticipating rowdy crowds and parking problems
league owners voted earlier thursday to play the 1990 all-star game at wrigley field if the city lifts the ban on night games
by playing during the day only, club executives say, the team misses out on lucrative revenue from tv networks interested in airing evening baseball
if the cubs made the playoffs while the night-game ban was in force, the team probably would have to play elsewhere, they say, because playoff games are scheduled to accommodate network requests for prime-time exposure
the cubs finished last in the national league east last year
opponents say night games in wrigleyville would mean boisterous fans pouring out of bars in the wee hours, limited parking for residents returning from work, and littered lawns and streets
i have no objection to people having a good time, but they just don't respect the neighborhood,'' said dwight guyer, who can hear the roar of the crowd from his home a few blocks away. ``i don't like people urinating in my yard. i don't like to wake up to trash.''
the chicago tribune, also owned by the tribune co., entered the fray last week with a lively editorial that said aldermen opposed to lights at wrigley field were ``boneheads'' and ``political lightweights.''
state sen. william marovitz, a chicago democrat, said the state noise law could prevent regular-season night games at wrigley
if the noise from wrigley field violates the decibel limit, a resident might file a lawsuit,'' said marovitz, who represents wrigleyville and is against the lights
but rep. john cullerton, another chicago democrat, said city council approval clears the way for regular-season night games without further legislative action
if we did nothing, they could play night games,'' said cullerton, who also represents wrigleyville
a bomb in a taxicab exploded wednesday outside the building housing the greek embassy in west beirut, killing a street vendor and a passenger in the car, police said
the cab driver and three passers-by were wounded when the bomb, hidden in the trunk of the moving taxi, blew up
police said the bomb exploded at 2:40 p.m. in front of the sadat tower, a building that also houses offices of the embassies of finland and mexico
police said there was nobody at the greek embassy at the time of the blast. no arrests were made
the finnish and mexican missions have been closed since april 1986, when most foreigners left moslem west beirut after a wave of assassinations and kidnappings involving foreign nationals
the bomb turned the white mercedes taxi into a pile of twisted metal. no group claimed responsibility for the bombing
syrian troops, who were deployed in west beirut to restore security, blocked off the site for half an hour after the explosion
more than 100,000 people have been killed since lebanon's civil war began in april 1975. druse, shiite moslem and christian militias have done most of the fighting
a former firefighter accused of setting a $6.5 million string of fires reported the first blaze to police and helped authorities erect barricades at the second fire, a prosecutor said thursday
adrian julius howe, 23, will be charged friday with six counts of arson, said okanogan county prosecutor jack burchard. he was ordered held on $250,000 bail. each count carries up to life in prison and a $50,000 fine
howe, arrested wednesday, reported the first blaze dec. 6 at an elementary school, helped set up barricades at a dec. 14 fire, and was seen by police at three other blazes, burchard told superior court judge james r. thomas
the fires began in december, when omak north elementary school was hit twice within eight days. two churches in omak and a church parsonage there also were burned in a week's time earlier this month
howe lived in a trailer court across the street from the school in december, then moved to an apartment across from one of the churches before the february fires, burchard said
howe, who sheriff jim weed said had experience fighting wildfires, was arrested by investigators of a special 12-member arson task force and confessed to all six fires, burchard told thomas
burchard and weed said there was no apparent motive for the fires. investigators have no reason to believe howe, a high school dropout, had any animosity toward the elementary school he attended, burchard said
the investigation depleted the small rural county's coffers, prompting the county to declare an emergency and request state help. the washington house voted wednesday to appropriate $150,000 to help cover the investigation costs
a lifelong resident of omak, a town of 4,000, howe was employed at a lumber mill on the colville indian reservation. friends who knew him from several bars he frequented described howe as a loner who used to get into fights
i don't think that he had anything to do with it,'' said brian marbach, a friend of howe's for 19 years

world production of sugar in 1987-88 has been revised upward to an estimated 101.9 million metric tons, a 1 percent increase from the previous forecast of 100.8 million tons made last october, the agriculture department said wednesday
the department's foreign agricultural service said the revision ``reflects changes in several key countries'' since the october estimate
regionally, the new figures showed increases in raw sugar production for north america, 10.92 million tons, compared with 10.71 million forecast in october; the european economic community, 13.85 million tons, compared with 13.43 million; and the soviet union, 9 million tons, compared with 8.3 million
despite the larger estimate, this season's global sugar production still is expected to trail the 102.8 million tons produced in 1986-87, the agency reported. of weapons, date of his eviction, comment from administrator of his current home. picks up 9th graf pvs, `several women ...'</note>
a elderly man with two rifles burst into a board meeting at a retirement home where he once lived and opened fire thursday, wounding four people and sending a fifth into heart failure, authorities said
the 79-year-old gunman fled the meeting room at the masonic home for the aged with one rifle tied around his neck with twine but surrendered moments later, said police spokesman dee anderson
the four people struck by gunfire suffered minor wounds, she said. however, willie joe wright, 67, who suffered the heart attack, was in critical condition at arlington memorial hospital, said spokeswoman tenya woods
apparently, they had a board meeting and one former resident, who was apparently disgruntled, walked into the board room and started shooting'' at the 15 to 16 people there, anderson said
the assailant, whose identity was not released, had lived at the home for about three years before being evicted in september for breaking rules, anderson said. he knew when the monthly board meeting was to be held, she said
when officers confronted the man in a kitchen in the building, he calmly surrendered and gave them his rifle. both weapons were .22-caliber semiautomatic rifles, anderson said
he did not give any information to police,'' anderson said
officials at the man's current residence, the arlington villa retirement home, said they were shocked to hear of the shooting. ``he is a good resident, very congenial and sociable,'' said administrator gennie pace
officials of the masonic home refused to comment on the 11 a.m. shooting and put the buildings and grounds of the home off limits to visitors
several women gathered outside the home after hearing of the shooting to make sure their relatives, residents of the home, were safe. one woman, who declined to be identified, said her mother had lived there for the past 13 years and called it ``a wonderful place.''
of the shooting victims, eldon brooks, 54, was in fair condition with a gunshot wound to the left thigh, ms. woods said, while frank smith, 77, was in good condition with a gunshot wound in his back
john thompson, 49, was in fair condition with a gunshot wound to his right arm and was later transferred to harris methodist hospital in fort worth
dorothy heath, 67, received a gunshot wound to her thigh and complained of chest pains. she was in fair condition
an employee at the retirement home who would not give her name identified ms. heath as the home's administrator
the state department on wednesday suggested that americans planning trips to rio de janeiro consider postponing their travel because of torrential rains and flooding that have killed 300 people and left thousands homeless
no formal travel advisory was announced, but ruth van heuven, a department spokeswoman, said people who called to check on conditions in the brazilian resort city were told they ``may wish to defer their trip until the local situation improves.''
the department said rains were expected to continue indefinitely, city services were strained, some areas were without electricity and water and several tourist areas were inaccessible
seven people were convicted wednesday on federal racketeering charges for taking part in the violent activities of a murderous gang known as the westies, which terrorized manhattan's hell's kitchen neighborhood for 20 years
an eighth defendant was acquitted of all charges as the five-month trial ended
in addition to the racketeering convictions, some of the defendants, including reputed westies boss james ``jimmy'' coonan, were found guilty of crimes ranging from attempted murder and loansharking to drug dealing and tax evasion
but the key verdict was the jury's decision that the westies did exist, that it constituted a racketeering enterprise and that the convicted defendants had participated in its activities to further the gang's criminal goals
defense lawyers had contended that there was no such organization as the westies. even former gang members testifying for the prosecution said the name ``westies'' was created by the police and the news media to describe irish-american hoodlums on manhattan's west side
prosecutors mary lee warren and david brodsky had contended the six men and two women on trial were the violent core of the westies, which they said seized control of the neighborhood once known as hell's kitchen and maintained their rule ``with horrible and ghoulish acts of murder.''
witnesses testified that in at least three murders, the victim's body was cut up and disposed of in what ms. warren called ``the nightmarish signature crime of the westies.''
there was also testimony by several witnesses that the westies had forged an alliance with the gambino organized crime family, said to be the largest and most powerful mafia group in the country
the key prosecution witness, former no. 2 westie francis ``mickey'' featherstone, said the gang had even shot a union leader as a favor to reputed gambino boss john gotti
but the defense attacked the credibility of featherstone, an admitted three-time killer, and other informants who testified for the government in return for leniency
featherstone, who said he had been coonan's ``right-hand man,'' admitted that he had lied under oath in other cases, had been in and out of mental institutions, suffered delusions and was a former abuser of alcohol and drugs
the racketeering charges alleged eight murders, four murder conspiracies and three attempted murders. to be convicted of racketeering, each defendant had to be found to have committed at least two of the 28 racketeering acts cited
the verdict came on the eighth day of jury deliberations
coonan, 41, was found guilty of attempted murder, murder conspiracy, loansharking, extortion and income tax evasion among other crimes
his wife, edna, 44, was convicted of loansharking and tax charges
in addition, the jury found coonan participated in most of the racketeering acts charged against him, including seven murders
a trial on any single act in this indictment would have resulted in an acquittal,'' said coonan's lawyer, gerald shargel. ``it's just a matter of the government, piling it all together. that's the nightmare of rico (the racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act).''
as the courtroom deputy, bernard wasserman, read out the verdict against william ``indian'' bokun, his father swore audibly
don't tell me to shush!'' john bokun angrily told a marshal. ``that's my son there.''
the younger bokun, 30, of manhattan, who was convicted of drug dealing as well as racketeering, tried to comfort his weeping, cursing father
don't worry pop, i'm all right,'' bokun shouted across the courtroom before being led back to jail
only one defendant, john halo, was acquitted on all charges
in addition to the coonans, both of hazlet, n.j. and bokun, the others convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy were: james ``jimmy mack'' mcelroy, 42; richard ``muggsy'' ritter, 50; thomas collins, 53, and his wife florence, 52, all of manhattan
knapp scheduled sentencing for april 18. all defendants face up to 20 years apiece on both racketeering and racketeering conspiracy
a publishing company's plan to offer a new series of magazines just for doctors' waiting rooms with the requirement that the physicians limit purchases of other magazines has rival publishers furious
the constitution says congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech,'' said george green, a vice president and group publisher of new york-based hearst corp. ``i guess the man from tennessee has his own agenda.''
whittle communications expects to put its six quarterly magazines in the waiting rooms of pediatricians, gynecologists and family practitioners this fall, said patti carr, the company's corporate marketing associate
whittle is targeting 15,000 doctors' offices its first year, and about half already have signed up, said spokeswoman sara fortune. eventually, whittle hopes to capture 40 percent of doctors' offices in the top 125 markets in the country, she said
under the subscription agreement, doctors cannot have more than two non-whittle publications in the waiting rooms, she said
in return, doctors get magazines at a reduced price, free monthly replacement of worn magazines and an agreement that there will be no ads for unhealthy products such as alcohol and cigarettes, said ms. fortune
the six magazines, collectively called ``the whittle family system,'' will cover beauty and health, living, family life, fiction, gossip, entertainment and sports
each one is designed to be read in 20 or 30 minutes, the time you usually spend waiting for your doctor,'' said ms. fortune
ms. carr predicted it would be ``the largest launch in the history of magazines.'' first-year revenues are projected at $37 million, she said
most publishers find this whole method unacceptable and are not going to sit idly by and let it happen,'' said michael luftman, a spokesman for time inc. in new york
whittle publishes special-interest magazines for such groups as students, restaurant workers and medical personnel
a hepatitis epidemic in shanghai has killed seven people, but the number of new cases has dropped considerably, the pro-beijing hong kong newspaper ta kung pao reported wednesday
it quoted wang daomin, director of the shanghai public health bureau, as saying health officials verified seven deaths. previous reports did not mention deaths
the viral disease, commonly spread in food and water, causes inflammation of the liver, nausea, vomiting and fever
wang also was quoted as saying the number of new cases of hepatitis a had dropped 80 percent from the height of the epidemic
shanghai officials earlier put the number sickened in the 2-month-old outbreak at 16,000. western doctors there said the number could be as high as 40,000. the epidemic was blamed on contaminated clams harvested from polluted coastal waters
china's official english-language newspaper china daily said beijing health authorities launched a city-wide sanitation inspection
in canton, capital of southern guangdong province, health officials warned people to refrain from shaking hands, to wash their hands when visiting others and to avoid eating river snails
weather experts failed to forecast britain's worst weather disaster in nearly 300 years because they stuck too rigidly to computer forecasts, an official report said wednesday
the oct. 16 storm killed 17 people and changed britain's landscape forever as winds gusting up to 120 mph toppled an estimated 15 million trees
homes were wrecked, cars smashed and many parts of britain suffered the worst power failures since the world war ii blitz. insurance claims totaled $1.46 billion
the report to defense secretary george younger came from the state-run meteorological office, under the defense department, and from an independent panel which studied that report and made its own inquiries and recommendations
it said weather experts failed to predict the storm's severity because they followed computer projections ``too closely'' and ``too rigidly'' and did not take into account other factors
the report recommended stepping up the warning system when bad weather is on the way and giving forecasters the scientific background needed to recognize poor computer predictions
compared with the french forecasters, the training which ours receive is shorter (and therefore cheaper) and lays less emphasis on meteorological theory,'' the report said
the defense secretary announced he had accepted the recommendations
the meteorological office apparently had no formal system to allow the senior forecaster to consult more widely when faced with uncertain or severe weather, the report said
it said television forecasts ``played down'' the wind even more than the meteorological office, but in view of the briefing tv weather experts received, they were not to blame
while the report said forecasters shouldn't rely totally on computers, it said the meteorological office must have the most powerful computer available. it noted a new model will be installed in june
the worst storm to hit britain was in 1703 when 8,000 people were killed
district of columbia police chief maurice turner said wednesday he intends to arm up to 1,000 civilian volunteers as part of an effort to fight a crime spree in the nation's capital
volunteer reserve officers, who currently lecture neighborhood groups on crime control and help city residents burglar-proof their homes, will get guns and full police powers, turner said in a statement issued by the police department
they'll serve in support positions augmenting the city's 3,880-member police force, accompany officers on regular patrols, and have the power to make arrests, he said
twenty-one members of the 175-member reserve force were selected for an extensive training program similar to training given full-time officers. turner said ultimately he hopes to expand the reserve corps to 1,000 officers
the trained reserve officers will carry a gun while on duty, but will be required to turn it in the end of their shifts, said turner, who originally disclosed his plan in an interview with the washington times
the chief's announcement came amid a surge in crime, particularly drug-related violence. fifty-two people have been murdered in washington so far this year, compared with 33 at this time last year. police say nearly three-quarters of the murders are drug related
turner said earlier this week that about 100 officers working at desk jobs will return to patrol work after civilians are found to fill their positions. last week, turner said he was replacing officers' six-shot service revolvers with 9mm semiautomatic pistols in an effort to counter the increasingly sophisticated weapons wielded by drug dealers
mayor marion barry has said there are enough officers, but police union officials said 500 more full-time officers are needed
turner did not say when the new program would go into effect, or where the reserves would be deployed. with comment from attorney general's office; adds one graf with suspect attempting suicide, in good condition.</note>
a grand jury should require tawana brawley and her family to cooperate with authorities investigating the teen-ager's alleged kidnapping and sexual assault by six white men, gov. mario cuomo said wednesday
the continued refusal of the girl's lawyers to allow her to discuss the case with investigators is fostering ``a disrespect for the process of law,'' the governor said at a news conference
miss brawley was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces, with ``kkk'' and ``nigger'' scrawled on her body, after being missing for four days last november. she said she was assaulted by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge
a grand jury will convene monday in poughkeepsie to investigate the case
cuomo said he'll ask state attorney general robert abrams, the special prosecutor in the case, to ask the grand jury to compel miss brawley and her family to cooperate
the way the investigation is not proceeding now _ and it's not proceeding as it should _ is bad for tawana, is bad for the state, is bad for the system of justice. and i want to change it,'' cuomo said
the lawyers for miss brawley and her family, c. vernon mason and alton maddox jr., did not return calls to their new york city offices
nancy connell, a spokeswoman for abrams, said that ``we're fully in agreement with the governor's statement.'' but she would not say what abrams will recommend to the grand jury
mason and maddox have advised miss brawley not to cooperate, have called for abrams to be removed from the case and for cuomo to create a permanent special state prosecutor for racial cases
the naacp lawyer who initially represented miss brawley before being replaced by mason and maddox said the two lawyers were using the girl as a pawn to achieve political aims
the politicizing of the case in the manner it has been allows for a lot of speculation and detracts from the genuine sympathy and outrage this case should have,'' attorney george hairston told the albany times union
the rev. al sharpton, a pentecostal minister from brooklyn who has also been advising the brawley family, said that because abrams maintains a residence in dutchess county he has a ``relationship'' with sheriff frederick scoralick. sharpton said scoralick was a ``suspect'' in the case
on tuesday, a former worker in the attorney general's print shop was arrested and charged with stealing and disclosing a transcript of testimony to a previous grand jury that was investigating the attack
samuel evans of manhattan allegedly took the transcript before leaving his job feb. 5. he then gave the transcript to an unidentified person, who notified authorities
on wednesday, evans attempted suicide by downing a quart of rubbing alcohol and other chemicals in his apartment, said new york city police spokesman raymond o'donnell. he was listed in good condition after having his stomach pumped
contra rebels damaged a microwave repeater tower in northern nicaragua overnight, cutting off telecommunications with northern central america and mexico, the defense ministry said wednesday
the brief defense statement said the tower was at mesa de las lagunas, outside the provincial capital of esteli, 90 miles north of the capital of managua. it did not say how the rebels damaged the tower or give other details
in guatemala city, bosco matamoros, a spokesman for the u.s.-backed rebels, said the contras blew up the tower at 1 a.m. wednesday
nicaragua is isolated,'' he said. the contras, he said, want to hinder communications between the country and the rest of central america
nicaragua could communicate by microwave with panama and costa rica but not with honduras, el salvador, guatemala and mexico. satellite communications were not affected
the rebels blew up a microwave repeater tower last october at laguna de santa clara, east of esteli, and destroyed another one in november at las cuchillas hill in chontales province, 90 miles east of managua. that sabotage also caused widespread outages
the rebels have been fighting for more than six years to oust the leftist sandinista government in nicaragua. the sandinistas came to power in july 1979 at the end of a revolutionary war that ended 42 years of rule by the rightist, pro-american somoza dynasty
an airline ticket agent suspicious about a man carrying two big suitcases for a three-hour visit to michigan tipped off police wednesday to what turned out to be an $11 million cocaine bust, authorities said
the man, who was arrested after his plane's arrival here, had bought a round-trip ticket in los angeles from the united airlines agent, said narcotics detective lt. gene wriggelsworth
he paid cash for his tickets,'' wriggelsworth said. ``he fit the drug smuggling profile.''
the detective said 14 kilos, or about 30 pounds of cocaine, were confiscated, ``the biggest we've ever had.''
a drug-sniffing dog was ready when the flight landed at capital city airport for the scheduled three-hour visit and singled out two large suitcases, wriggelsworth said
police then watched as the man claimed the suitcases and met two people. all three were arrested, and a car and $4,000 in cash were confiscated with the cocaine
the three were being held in the clinton county jail on drug-possession charges. their names were not released
the name of the united agent was not immediately available
a jury on wednesday acquitted a police officer of manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed black teen-ager last year, a case that sparked accusations of racism in the montreal police department
the nov. 11 shooting of 19-year-old anthony griffin had prompted three inquiries _ by the quebec human rights commission, the quebec police commission and the 4,500-member montreal police force
a black community leader, ronald rock, said wednesday that blacks will march in the streets following the acquittal of constable allan gosset, 38, a 16-year veteran of the department
gosset, who said the shooting was accidental, rolled his eyes, sighed and slumped in his chair when the all-white jury of seven men and five women handed down the verdict after deliberating 16{ hours. the trial lasted four days
griffin's mother, gloria augustus, wept as she left the courtroom, and exclaimed: ``you want us to trust the justice system? what kind of a justice system do we have?''
rock, executive director of the black community council of quebec, said, ``i'm very disappointed. this has set relations with the montreal police back 15 years. we're going to have to hit the streets again.''
gosset said he will have to await police chief roland bourget's decision on whether he will return to work
i think i should be reinstated,'' he said
griffin was brought to a police station in a patrol car by gosset and his partner last november, according to testimony. he bolted in the parking lot but obeyed gosset's shouted order to stop
griffin turned around and gosset shot him once in the forehead with his .38-caliber service revolver, testimony showed
gosset said griffin turned to face him, went into a crouch and began weaving from side to side. gosset said he feared griffin planned to confront him so he drew his gun to intimidate him and it went off, although he did not recall cocking it
defense lawyer serge menard told the jury it was obvious gosset's actions were not motivated by racism, because griffin was being detained on the basis of an arrest warrant
crown prosecutor rene de la sablonniere said gosset was irresponsible and should not have pulled his gun because his life was not in danger
on wednesday, griffin's mother told reporters she was ``shocked and saddened'' by the verdict and promised to pursue the case. lawyers for the family said they filed a wrongful-death lawsuit for $850,000 tuesday against gosset, the police department and montreal's regional government

leaders of 100 minority students occupying a hampshire college building handed the school's president a list of demands wednesday and settled in for what they predicted would be a long siege
we're a little disappointed. they wouldn't even talk to us,'' said dean of students trey williams after a morning meeting with the protesters was cut short
we felt that they needed to take time to look at the demands,'' responded anita fearman, a student from los angeles and a protest leader. another meeting was scheduled for thursday
some 50 black, hispanic, asian, indian and other students, or nearly half the minority student population at the 1,100-student private liberal arts college, took over dakin house on tuesday to protest what they described as the administration's indifference to their longstanding complaints
another 50 minority students from nearby smith, amherst, and mount holyoke colleges and the university of massachusetts joined the protesters wednesday, said ms. fearman. umass was the site of a similar protest that ended last week
about 300 sympathizers, most of them white, accompanied the negotiators to the meeting with administrators wednesday in a library building, where the demands were given to president adele simmons
the crowd marched through classroom and administration buildings on the way, chanting, ``racism has got to go.''
a protest leader, penny predmas, predicted: ``this is going to take a while.''
among the dozen demands of the group, students of underrepresented cultures, were calls for money for third world speakers and publications, the hiring of a racial harassment officer and the drafting of a racial harassment policy
williams, who is black, said school officials were worried that students might be seeking attention rather than results by delaying negotiations
usually building takeovers are the last resort,'' he said. ``i don't know why the students feel they have no other recourse.''
the takeover followed the six-day occupation of a building at nearby umass. that occupation by 125 students ended feb. 17 with an agreement to increase minority recruitment at the 25,000-student campus
the problems (at hampshire) are the same, although the sizes of the minority communities are different,'' said ms. fearman. ``there's a general feeling here that we've been more or less pushed under the rug.''
dakin house contains living quarters for two staff members, an office and meeting space used by minority students. the staff members are being allowed to use their living quarters during the occupation
a free-lance writer from oregon paddled his teakwood boat into bangkok wednesday, the 55th day of his solo exploration of the effect of rivers on thailand's history and culture
two dozen thais greeted an exhausted and tanned steve van beek, offering him food and soda as he pulled into a pier near the foot of the memorial bridge
van beek, 43, of portland, ore., said he expected to complete his nearly 600-mile journey on saturday, when he is scheduled to reach the gulf of thailand at samut prakarn province just southeast of bangkok
van beek paddled his 11{-foot-long boat by day, seeking shelter with local residents at night and listening to their stories of the river and its effect on their lives. he sampled what he called a ``whole new experience'' of food, including raw fish with rice, pig's blood and boiled eel
he said the beauty of the countryside and the hospitality of the thai people have impressed him
how many other places could you walk up to someone and say, `i'm paddling a boat. i need something to eat, a place to stay, something to eat in the morning,''' he said. ``these people, they just opened up their entire houses.''
water, he said, ``permeates every aspect of life in thailand. it is in rites of passage, festivals. fish and rice are both grown in water, and they are the principal sources of food here.''
i lived on the edge of the river for 11 years,'' he added. ``i always wondered where it came from, so i decided to go find out.''
van beek hired a village builder to fashion the flat-bottomed boat
he started his trip in meaja, about 60 miles north of the provincial capital of chiang mai. he followed the ping river south through five provinces, after which it joined the chao phraya river
van beek spent three years in a village in nepal as a peace corps volunteer before arriving in thailand in 1969. he worked on english-language newspapers and magazines before 1977, when he became a free-lance writer and film maker specializing in thailand's art, history and culture
a man was convicted of manslaughter wednesday in the snakebite-death of a girl around whose shoulder he had draped a rattlesnake
district judge j. philip eves announced the verdict against darrell wessendorf in the non-jury trial
wessendorf, 24, had been charged with second-degree murder in the death last year of 21-month-old stevie luren kirkwood of la verkin. he had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity
the judge said that he found wessendorf guilty of the lesser charge because the defendant hadn't been aware of the possible results of his actions
wessendord, who was renting an upstairs apartment from the child's mother, jeri ann kirkwood, at the time, testified that he found the 5-foot rattlesnake on a road and was trying to show the girl that that it would not hurt her
he said he had partially wrapped the snake around the child's shoulder when mrs. kirkwood entered the room and screamed, causing him to flinch and the snake to bite the child
sentencing was set for april 11. manslaughter carries a one- to 15-year sentence. second-degree murder would have brought five years to life
defense attorney j. macarthur wright had claimed that only 0.2 percent of those bitten by rattlesnakes die and called on the judge to ``make a distinction here on what constitutes a grave risk of death.''
people bitten by rattlesnakes are often not even treated,'' he said
prosecutor o. brent rowe argued that wessendorf's actions were intentional and malicious
earlier wednesday, a psychologists, george dunford, said that wessendorf suffered from mild schizophrenia and that he did not believe the defendant understood he was endangering the child
an expert on snakes, james glenn, testified for the defense that the snake is one of the least aggressive types of rattlers and that the hospital did not give the girl enough anti-venom
col. ali saibou, military ruler of niger, has granted what amounts to a pardon for people who attempted two coups against his predecessor
the pardon took the form of a general amnesty for those convicted of crimes against state security, according to broadcasts wednesday by the west african country's official radio
such an amnesty would free officers and civilians involved in attempted the coups against maj. gen. seyni kountche, who died in a paris hospital nov. 10 of what was believed to be a brain tumor. the radio said the amnesty bars those released from holding government jobs except after official review
excluded from the pardon was amadou oumarou, a wealthy businessman and former close adviser of kountche, who failed in a third coup attempt oct. 6, 1983. he was said to be living in belgium
most of the plotters and other political prisoners are held in the arid northeastern part of the country or exiled to their villages, and some fled the country. the radio did not say how many people were involved
in january, saibou granted a partial amnesty to military personnel convicted of lesser crimes, except for those who violated ``morality and honor,'' an apparent reference to convicted coup plotters. the january decision also commuted to life imprisonment all death sentences announced before 1988
hamani diori, niger's first president after independence from france in 1960, was given his freedom from house arrest early in 1987. kountche overthrew diori, now in his 80s, in 1974
niger, part of the drought-stricken sahel region, is one of the world's poorest countries with a population of 6 million and a per capita annual income of about $250. the government said in january it needed 274,000 tons of grain to avoid food shortages for 1.4 million people
health officials wednesday battled an outbreak of disease after rains, floods and mudslides killed at least 277 people in rio de janeiro state
the rio state health secretariat is promoting a vaccination campaign against tetanus, hepatitis, typhoid fever and leptosipirosis caused by rats and contaminated water
the most serious outbreak was of leptospirosis, an infection caused by rat urine and droppings in water. the often fatal disease produces high fever, vomiting, diarrhrea and sometimes paralysis of the kidneys
the health secretariat said wednesday that 223 cases of leptospirosis had been registered, with 15 deaths. most victims were from the low-lying slums north of rio hit hardest by the flooding, which began feb. 2
health workers urged people to boil drinking water and use chlorine to treat water stored in cisterns. rio residents were urged not to walk barefoot through flood water, because the disease can be contracted through tiny cuts and breaks in the skin
foreign countries have donated or pledged about $2 million in money, food, medicine and equipment. japan promised to send vaccine. west germany planned to donate 1 million disposable syringes and needles and $300,000, civil defense officials said
rescue workers kept digging for bodies in mud and rubble left by a violent downpour that began friday and lasted three days. at least 81 rio residents were killed by floods and mudslides in the past three weeks
firemen and civil defense workers recovered a 12th body from the ruins of a hillside clinic for the elderly that collapsed under a mudslide. officials say 15 more bodies could still be under the tons of mud and concrete
president jose sarney visited the worst hit regions tuesday and allocated $2 million for repairs. but rio mayor roberto saturnino braga said the city would need at least $100 million
in washington, the state department on wednesday suggested that americans planning trips to rio consider postponing travel there, though no formal travel advisory was announced
a mixture of cleaning chemicals sent fumes through a school wednesday, sickening at least 149 people, most of them students, authorities said
a 12-year-old girl with a history of respiratory ailments was admitted to holy family hospital in des plaines for observation, said spokesman frank buccitelli. the other victims were treated at hospitals and released
most of those affected by the fumes at thomas junior high school complained of dizziness, nausea and shortness of breath
maintenance men were cleaning a drain,'' said police cmdr. jay plaisted. ``they used a degreaser and a drain opener, and the two together gave off a noxious odor
they opened a window to try to air out the fumes, but the mixture had already moved through the pipes into other rooms in the school,'' plaisted said
before noon, state environmental officials declared the school safe and classes resumed for most of the 700 students, said assistant principal al swanson
two women handcuffed together in a practical joke had to search the city for the prankster when police couldn't unlock the cuffs
ann bishop, 53, and her cuffmate, stephanie henson, 30, showed up at the public safety building close to midnight monday, seeking release from the cuffs
the women said they had gone to the spokane international airport with about 10 other family members and friends dressed in costumes ranging from maids to punks to meet ms. henson's brother, jimmy skog, arriving from austin, texas
skog ``just grabbed us and put them (the handcuffs) on before we knew what was happening,'' ms. bishop said
after police determined they were unable to unlock the cuffs, the women hit the streets to find skog, she said
we found him down at perkins (restaurant) having some coffee and talked him into setting us free,'' ms. bishop said. ``now we are going to have to think of something really good for him. we'll get him back.''
britain's government and opposition leaders condemned south africa's crackdown on major black organizations wednesday and feared the move would bring the ``frustration and despair'' that breed violence
britain, the staunchest opponent of sanctions against south africa, faced renewed demands from the opposition labor party and the anti-apartheid movement organization that prime minister margaret thatcher approve tough embargoes against south africa
neil kinnock, labor party leader, said the thatcher government ``bears a heavy responsibility,'' for the south african government ban on political activity by 18 major black movements opposed to apartheid, including the united democratic front
because it has been so weak against apartheid, we now have even more vicious jackboot rule,'' kinnock said
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said he was ``shocked and saddened'' by the crackdown
we do not see how the suppression of non-violent political activity can possibly contribute to a peaceful solution to south africa's problems,'' howe said in a statement, describing the ban as ``oppressive.''
we are particularly concerned that the black opposition in south africa should not lose hope of peaceful fundamental change. frustration and despair breed violence,'' howe added
sir shridath ramphal, secretary-general of the commonwealth, called on the international community, particularly western countries opposed to sanctions, to show south africa ``in every possible way ... that this repression is as intolerable as apartheid.''
mrs. thatcher regularly has been isolated at summits of the commonwealth, the 48-nation association of britain and its former colonies, for her refusal to impose tough embargoes against south africa, a major trading partner
the anti-apartheid movement planned demonstrations at the south african embassy and said it would join other groups in an ``international demonstration.''
anti-apartheid movement president, anglican archbishop trevor huddleston, said south africa ``is once again prohibiting non-violent resistance to apartheid and has slammed the door on any prospect of genuine negotiation.''
britain and south africa's other major trading partners must act decisively,'' huddleston added, saying he would appeal again to mrs. thatcher to change her stance on sanctions
mrs. thatcher argues that harsh sanctions against south africa will harden white resistance to change, harm blacks most, and be evaded by third party countries which are not now big trading partners
by law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which south africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services
tens of thousands of health workers marched in scottish cities wednesday as part of a one-day walkout by 60,000 workers at hospitals nationwide, police and union officials said
the scottish trade unions congress called the strike to protest a government plan to force state-run hospitals to compete competitively with private bidders for auxiliary services
about 15,000 workers marched in glasgow and 10,000 in edinburgh, police said. they estimated about 60,000 people took part in the walkout
a union spokesman said rallies were also held in dundee, aberdeen, inverness, lochgilphead and dumfries
union officials said all hospitals remained equipped to give emergency services, but government officials alleged that even those services were not being provided in some areas
michael forsyth, the british lawmaker responsible for health care in scotland, said in a radio interview with the british broadcasting corp. that he was ``disgusted'' at the lack of care available
he said he would talk with the strikers when ``they stop organizing attacks on the sick and stop organizing disruption in our hospitals.''
the situation caused an angry clash between opposition and government lawmakers in the house of commons in london
conservatives shouted ``disgraceful!' in response to remarks by the opposition party's spokesman for scotland, donald dewar, that the protest was justified
scottish secretary malcolm rifkind said the strike ``has led to operations being canceled in their hundreds, and it will undoubtedly add to waiting lists over the weeks and months to come.''
health workers have staged regional walkouts recently, but tuesday's action was the first nationwide protest
forsyth said the government would not changes its plans, saying the strike pointlessly damaged the national health service, which provides free health care to britons
the scottish action follows the feb. 3 walkout by nurses in london to demand higher pay and more government funding of the health service. automakers and teachers also staged separate strikes this month
u.s. and mexican officials pledged to exchange more tariff and investment information during talks that reviewed a trade agreement last year, the newspaper el nacional announced wednesday
but the two sides reached no new concrete agreements during talks monday and tuesday, officials said
we held informal discussions, nothing more,'' said a u.s. official close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``they never were intended to be negotiations.''
el nacional, citing attending mexican officials, said the two sides ``agreed to establish a greater flow of more precise and opportune information in tariff and foreign investment matters.''
the two nations trade about $30 billion worth of goods and services
the u.s. delegation, led by deputy trade representative peter murphy, met with its mexican counterpart, headed by foreign trade undersecretary luis bravo aguilera, at the resort of cocoyoc, south of mexico city
under the nov. 6 pact, mexican and u.s. officials will meet periodically to review progress made in foreign investment, services, patents and copyrights, textiles, steel, electronics, agricultural products and information exchanges
the u.s. trade representative and mexican commerce department reached separate agreements on steel, shoes, beer and textiles late last year
the textile accord, signed by presidents reagan and miguel de la madrid at their feb. 13 summit meeting in mazatlan, permits mexico to increase such exports to the united states by about 6 percent each year. in turn, mexico is opening its domestic market to many finished u.s. textile products for the first time
on other issues, the two sides remain far apart. the united states has pressed for mexico to liberalize its foreign investment law, generally restricted to 49 percent of ownership in mexican enterprises
mexico has resisted tampering with the law, but it did set up task force to look at the issue
another point of friction is mexico's law on patents and copyrights, which u.s. officials consider too weak to permit american manufacturers _ particularly in pharmaceuticals _ to export much to mexico
the united states, mexico's largest trading partner, takes in a third of mexico's exports and provides about the same percentage of its imports. mexico ranks fourth as a trading partner with its northern neighbor, after canada, japan and west germany
the son of former president gamal abdel nasser of egypt will return to egypt to stand trial, a lawyer was quoted as saying thursday
president hosni mubarak said terrorism allegations against khaled abdel nasser will not tarnish the image of the late president
the daily al ahram newspaper quoted ahmed el-khawaga, head of the egyptian bar association, as saying the younger nasser, 38, would return to cairo as soon as the trial starts. the report appeared in the newspaper's early thursday edition
el-khawaga made his comments after returning from meetings with khaled nasser in belgrade, yugoslavia, where the younger nasser and his family live
no date has been set for the trial
khaled nasser and 19 men were charged last thursday in connection with four shootings between 1984 and 1987 that killed two israelis and wounded six others and two americans
he and 10 other defendants face a death sentence. eight defendants face a maximum life imprisonment
el-khawaga was not at his office and there was no answer at his home when the associated press tried to obtain further information about his four reported meetings with the younger nasser
in his first public comment on the indictment, mubarak said khaled nasser's alleged involvement in the attacks ``will not affect the name and history of leader gamal abdel nasser, whom egypt respects and loves and whom the whole world, including the arab world and our african continent, also loves.''
mubarak spoke at a closed meeting with senior officers of egypt's 2nd and 3rd armies, both stationed in the suez canal zone. his remarks at the canal city of ismailiya were distributed wednesday by the state-owned middle east news agency
egypt has said it is attempting to have khaled nasser extradited to stand trial
another defendant is gamal shawky abdel nasser, a nephew of the late president. he is also at large, but he faces lesser charges
nasser, who died in 1970, became president of republican egypt in 1956, four years after leading a bloodless military coup that overthrew the monarchy
a champion of arab unity and an inspiration to numerous african and arab liberation movements, he still is revered in much of the arab world and in many african countries
a worldwide nuclear warning system was tested without a hitch wednesday after an earlier one sparked unfounded fears of a second serious nuclear accident in the soviet union
during the test, attended by reporters, a nuclear plant in west germany transmitted routine meteorological data to the vienna-based international atomic energy agency
sixteen countries taking part in the test confirmed within 30 minutes that they received the information. agency officials hailed the test as a success of the sophisticated new warning system
the system has become extremely important after the cherbobyl nuclear accident, said morris rosen, nuclear safety director for the agency
a test of the warning system earlier this month was misinterpreted, prompting momentary fear worldwide of a nuclear accident in the soviet union
the warning system, called the global telecommunication system, can be picked up at 160 points throughout the world, mostly national meteorologcal centers. it receives information from nuclear reactors worldwide and is expected to become fully operational this summer
the april 26, 1986, accident at the nuclear reactor at chernobyl, about 80 miles north of kiev, was the world's worst nuclear reactor accident. it killed 31 people, hospitalized hundreds and sent a cloud of radiation around the world
a 16-month-old-girl was in extremely critical condition wednesday after being bitten by a swarm of ants in her back yard, a hospital spokeswoman said
tiffany cheatham had stopped breathing after the attack but was revived by rescuers who arrived at her home tuesday in navarre, 20 miles from here, said james chalmers, an emergency medical technician
a witness said a dog had knocked the girl into an ant bed, according to chief don van derryt of the holley-navarre fire and rescue association
there were ants all around all of us,'' said janet streaker, a neighbor who tried to help the child's mother, lynn cheatham, remove the insects. ``the mother is full of ant bites herself.''
she said ms. cheatham took off the child's clothing and put her in the bathtub to try to wash off the ants, which were entangled in the girl's hair
there were lots of them,'' she said. ``there are still ants in the bathroom.''
ann papadelias, a sacred heart hospital spokeswoman, said that she suspected the girl was attacked by fire ants, known for painful and sometimes deadly stings, but that she was unable to confirm that with doctors
a secret presidential report on the sex-for-secrets spy scandal at the u.s. embassy in moscow says the american ambassador, his staff, and state department officials in washington must share the blame along with the marines
the report describes a ``seedy, disgraceful'' embassy marked by confused policies, lax supervision and ``gross neglect'' of counterintelligence efforts
president reagan ordered the study last spring after sensational reports that marines sold secrets for sex and allowed soviet agents into the building. the state department has refused to release the report to the public
people who receive transfusions face a one in 40,000 chance of receiving aids-tainted blood despite screening intended to keep the blood supply clean, according to a federal study published today
the researchers emphasize that despite this ``remote but real risk,'' people who need transfusions should not be deterred from receiving them
the blood supply is relatively safe, dramatically safer than it was before we had any screening,'' said the chief author of the report, dr. john w. ward of the u.s. centers for disease control in atlanta
the u.s.-soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in europe will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to verify and an additional investment of billions more for non-nuclear weapons, the nation's top civilian and military defense officials warn
the pentagon is seeking $198 million this year and another $148 million in fiscal 1989 to ensure verification against soviet cheating, according to defense secretary frank c. carlucci
that money will go for a variety of costs, including the on-site inspections which are a key feature of the strictest verification standards in the history of nuclear arms control, carlucci told the house armed services committee on wednesday
if it didn't hurt so much, you might be able to step back and appreciate what critics are citing as a monumental example of man's folly _ the tax system
but for most people it probably does hurt too much to look, since they are involved deeply, intricately, confusingly, often desperately and frequently bizarrely
consider: it is entirely possible, says professor robert doyle, for a taxpayer to be actively rather than passively involved in a real estate matter that, by official definition, is a passive activity
a few days ago the internal revenue service tried to explain the riddle, but it is difficult to believe it succeeded in doing much more than adding to the confusion of those who seek to understand
such anomalies aren't uncommon. the latest tax law, for instance, is said to be fairer and simpler. it is neither, says doyle, who helps train chartered financial analysts at the american college in bryn mawr, pa
americans have been ``mugged,'' he says
doyle's comment is one of an almost infinite list of criticisms by an almost endless number of critics, including taxpayers, philosophers, historians and authorities on taxes who previously had thought they were experts
among the criticisms:
_many members of congress didn't even understand what they had done in passing the latest tax bill, having bothered to read only a small part of it
_there has been almost no ``tax policy'' in recent years. in the span between 1964 and 1984, congress enacted 16 major tax bills and dozens of lesser bills
example: the economic recovery tax act of 1981 promised corporate tax reductions averaging $51 billion in the years 1987 to 1989. but by 1986, says the tax foundation, this reduction had become a $20 billion-a-year increase
_under the latest tax laws, individuals are responsible for adjusting their withholding statements in order to avoid underwithholding. in 1987, millions didn't. the internal revenue service forgave most of them
as a consequence, those who had fulfilled their responsibilities were put at a disadvantage: they lost the use of the withheld money. those who failed in their responsibility were rewarded by having the money to use
_in some instances, ``unearned income,'' such as dividends, continues to be treated differently from ``earned income,'' despite the wailing of those who saved their earnings to invest, and thereby earn ``unearned income.''
_nobody knows the answers. varying interpretations of the same information are made by professional tax preparers and even by internal revenue service personnel. as a result, similar tax returns are treated differently
in the view of many critics, the decades of amending, rescinding, revoking, reimposing, reconciling and correcting could be adding up to something far more serious than confusion. it could, they say, undermine faith
that undermining could also be widespread. it could, many believe, destroy faith in the tax system and encourage tax evasion. but worse, it could endanger confidence in government altogether
what can be claimed for the tax system is that it has produced an industry that seems destined to continue growing, perhaps even while other businesses are fighting to remain solvent during times of recession
billions of dollars each year go to accountants, attorneys, tax preparers, investment advisers, tax-guide publishers and others whose products and services are deemed necessary by taxpayers
how much the industry contributes to the productivity and well-being of americans is another matter

you don't tug on superman's cape.''
_ jim croce
you don't make fun of truth, justice and the american way, but, seriously folks, how do you do a documentary on superman with a straight face?
superman's 50th anniversary: a celebration of the man of steel,'' airing monday on cbs, is a charming, gentle poke at the superhero, tinged with a hint of lingering childhood awe. superman arrived on earth from krypton in action comics in february 1938
host dana carvey of ``saturday night live'' takes viewers through a 1-hour comic documentary that pretends the man of steel is a real guy and metropolis a real town _ albeit one that looks suspiciously like new york
some of the original superman players are featured. announcer jackson beck _the guy who originally said, ``look! up in the sky!'' _ does the show's opening narration
a lovely noel neill, who played lois lane, is interviewed as lois' mother. she complains that no one was ever good enough for her daughter after superman. ``i've tried to fix her up with other men, but it's always, `can he break through walls? he is bullet-proof?'''
there are straight interviews with jack larson, who played cub reporter jimmy olsen and is now a movie producer, and kirk alyn, the first superman, in the movie serials that ran from 1948 to 1950
i felt i was a creator. i created it, i made him look like this, i made him strong, and they believed me,'' alyn says proudly. the late george reeves was the most famous superman, starring in the television series of the 1950s
footage of superman through the decades, up through christopher reeve, is interwoven with new ``interviews,'' like the one with syndicated columnist jimmy breslin, who worked for the daily planet's competitor
i'd have to say that perry white made all the right moves,'' breslin says of his rival's editor. ``he's got a very streamlined staff. what has he got? essentially three reporters.''
hal holbrook has a new one-man broadway show, we're told. he is interviewed backstage _ in his distinguished gray hair and blue tights
and thugs sit around in a bar reminiscing about their inability to resist wasting bullets on the man of steel _ ``i just kept shooting on the chance that one would get through.''
ultracool lou reed, wearing shades and puffing on a butt, is interviewed on a street corner: ``superman? i liked him better before when he was more subtle. ... now he's flashier, he's more into spectacle.''
we also visit a trailer on the outskirts of town, home of superman's ``love child,'' and his mother, played by jan hooks of ``snl.'' her son, she says, ``has that x-ray vision, but only in one eye, so he gets these terrible headaches,'' then urges, ``junior, lift up the nova.''
also appearing in the special are fred willard, peter boyle, tom davis and al franken, carol leifer, brian doyle murray, the amazing kreskin and ralph nader, among many others
the special was produced by ``snl'' executive producer lorne michaels, ``snl'' writers wrote it _ one of them, rosie shuster, is coincidentally related to joe shuster, one of superman's creators _ and the producer is mary salter, a former producer at ``snl.'' but the show hasn't the biting satire ``snl'' is known for
i think that we felt we wanted to actually honor the character and honor everything about the whole comic-book phenomenon and how this whole sense of a superhero came into being,'' said salter. ``we didn't really want to go after that satirically, that was never our objective. ... we wanted to be pretty gentle.''
i think the sense of humor is quite sly and also gentle, so that it isn't a hard comedy show and doesn't tend to mock superman or whatever,'' said michaels. ``it's just bright and charming and i think the sort of thing you don't get to do in a special.''
in the finale, a star-studded crowd awaits the arrival of superman at a gala celebration
i have a plan to destroy superman at the moment he arrives,'' says the brainwave (played by writer robert smigel), ``but mostly, i'm here to see the stars.''
you don't tug on superman's cape? well, maybe just a little
elsewhere in television:
mtv gathers rolling stone editor _ author and former rolling stone magazine editor kurt loder is joining mtv as anchor of the music video network's ``mtv news'' show. loder will also anchor the ``week in rock'' weekend half hour. ``mtv news'' airs each hour. loder's debut, on feb. 27, will take a look at the hottest rock tours and include opening-night footage of three biggies, bruce springsteen, michael jackson and george michael
the worst is over,'' the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc. advised last weekend in network television commercials
it followed up this week with full-page newspaper ads that gave nine reasons why it thinks ``we have seen the lows of this bear market.''
pretty gutsy,'' observed jack trout, who heads a marketing strategy firm, trout &amp; ries inc. in new york. but he said if the market heads south, the ``next headline will have to read, `oops'.''
brokerage firms frequently offer advice and market observations in newsletters sent directly to clients. but they often make only general observations about the likely direction of the market in their advertising
shearson's marketing director, cathleen stewart, says the new ad is another in a series of ``out on the limb statements'' about market conditions that the firm has put in its advertising in the past few years
for instance, shearson has incorporated its views on the outlook for interest rates, the stock market and related issues into full-page newspaper ads that have appeared at the start of the year for several years
this january, shearson's 1988 outlook ad said the firm doubted the economy was facing an economic decline, it didn't expect another sharp drop in the stock market leading to new lows and it foresaw a decline in interest rates
two months later, reports indicate the economy continues to expand, the dow jones industrial average is up 100 points from the end of 1987 and yields on 30-year treasury bonds are down 0.6 percentage point since dec. 31
but what happens if the firm makes a wrong call?
we are all very clear that if we say something is going to occur and doesn't, we have to go out in the same way to say so,'' ms. stewart said
the latest ads come against the backdrop of the black monday stock market crash four months ago. in the wake of the crash, several large investment firms dashed off ads that were designed mainly to calm investors and encouraged them to call their brokers for individually tailored advice
merrill lynch, pierce, fenner &amp; smith, for instance, put some of its top executives on the air to reaffirm merrill's faith in the underlying strength of the economy and the market. in recent weeks, merrill lynch has begun using several of its brokers in ads describing what they are telling clients
but at the same time, merrill lynch completed a new series of ads that it began working on last spring. the ads, which began running on the abc-tv's olympics broadcasts, talk about the origins of the firm
in one ad, a merrill employee tells a train conductor about the company's plans to bring wall street to main street in the 1920s as he sets out to open a branch office in milwaukee
shearson is working on new image-projecting advertising that will reflect its incorporation of the newly acquired e.f. hutton, ms. stewart said

she said the firm surveyed 1,000 actual or potential brokerage clients in december and found ``an overwhelming majority'' blamed themselves af
iowa is done. new hampshire is history. it's on to super tuesday
on march 8, voters in 20 states and america samoa will state their presidential preferences in the biggest one-day primary season balloting ever
democrats will choose 1,307 delegates, almost a third of all the delegates to the national convention in atlanta. republicans will pick 712 delegates, again about a third of the delegates to the gop convention in new orleans
to raise the stakes a bit, look at it this way: on super tuesday almost 63 percent of the magic number of delegates needed to win the nomination will be selected
although 14 of the 20 states are southern or border states, the candidates are faced with a disparate set of voters _ from the textile-and tobacco-dominated carolinas through booming georgia and florida to the oil-depressed states of louisiana and texas
here is a look at how the races are shaping up in each state:
the race remains cloudy in alabama, where about 20 percent of the 2.3 million registered voters are black
republicans have spent little time campaigning for the 38 delegates. tom coker, a veteran political organizer who directs the business council of alabama, said he feels the top three finishers may be no more than 10 to 12 percentage points apart, with vice president george bush first and former television evangelist pat robertson battling sen. bob dole for second
on the democratic side, much of jesse jackson's civil rights time was spent in alabama and he has benefited from that recognition
early polls showed jackson in the lead with better than 20 percent, followed closely by tennessee sen. albert gore jr., with missouri rep. richard gephardt third. but those polls had large undecided blocs, and it's expected that massachusetts gov. michael dukakis and gephardt improved their standing here after early wins
alabama has 56 democratic delegates at stake
another factor in alabama is the democrats' attempt to limit cross-over voting by adopting a rule preventing anyone from voting in the republican presidential primary march 8 and then coming back and voting in any democratic primary in june when state and local nominees will be chosen. the republican party has no similar rule
the rule may discourage some generally conservative democrats from voting in the republican primary as they have tended to do in years past. it also may turn some independent conservative robertson voters into republicans
the smallest player on super tuesday is american samoa, where about 300 people are expected to participate in the democratic party caucus that night. the south pacific territory will send three delegates to atlanta
chairman utu r.m. sinagege says the caucus will decide whether delegates will go instructed or uncommitted. ``we would rather wait to see where the trend is going ... who doesn't make the cut,'' he said
in american samoa, people don't have to show proof of party registration to attend a caucus. ``the place is so small, everyone knows everybody and it would be hard for anyone (who is not democrat) to slip into the caucus,'' sinagege said
arkansas republicans expect a large turnout that may benefit robertson and hurt bush, who was ahead early, said state executive director dorothy english. she attributes many of the new republicans to robertson's candidacy
in all, about 1.2 million arkansans are eligible to vote march 8, up about 5,000 from 1986
about 16 percent of the population is black
democratic executive director kip blakely says jackson and gore are the perceived leaders, but he says dukakis and gephardt are gaining strength. ``it looks like a four-man race,'' he said
blakely predicts an average turnout of democrats, about 450,000 to 500,000 for the primary. however, the turnout of republicans may triple or quadruple with 75,000 to 100,000 expected to vote
i think you're going to see pat robertson people crawl out from under the woodwork,'' blakely said
arkansas has 38 democratic and 27 republican delegates at stake
after texas, florida has the biggest chunk of delegates with 136 democrats and 82 republicans up for grabs
dukakis has been in florida early and often. his campaign set up offices last august with 16 full-time staffers and has added staff steadily since iowa and new hampshire. phone banks have been running in all 19 congressional districts
gephardt has successfully raised money here, and is counting on 87-year-old rep. claude pepper, the nation's most popular democratic campaigner, to get out the elderly vote, which might hurt dukakis
jackson, who boasts six campaign offices in the state, has an active grassroots organization
gore's main presence has been his father, former sen. albert gore sr., who the campaign is using in south florida retiree areas, and in conservative northwest florida
most democratic officials say the race is too close to call and polls in the last 10 days generally give gary hart, jackson and dukakis the most strength, although hart's support may be attributed to name recognition
simon ferro, a member of the democratic national committee, said that although florida is a media state, ``you still need an organization to get the people out and to pass the word.''
gephardt probably has the weakest organization in florida but he does have the endorsements of a number of officials. whether they can provide the organization for him, i don't know,'' ferro said
if dukakis does well, it will prove that money and good, early organization does pay off,'' said katharine kelly, a member of the state's democratic central committee
bush has the most extensive republican campaign, running with five full-time professionals headed by state executive director ken wright
although robertson continues to outspend bush, and is considered strong is some gop pockets, particularly north florida, bush has enjoyed commanding leads in nearly every poll conducted recently
in an effort to catch up, dole was in florida last week and plans later trips
the latest registration figures, which are more than 15 months old, showed florida with 3.2 million democrats, including 554,585 blacks, and 2 million republicans, including 21,716 blacks
cross-over voting is not permitted
in georgia, one of three southern states to hold a presidential primary on the same day four years ago, bush is the acknowledged leader for the 48 republican delegates, but uncertainty over robertson's ``invisible army'' clouds most predictions
on the democratic side, it's a three-man race among dukakis, jackson and gephardt@gore, depending on who's doing the talking. the state will send 77 committed delegates to the convention in atlanta in july
you have to say gephardt is the man to beat,'' said pollster claibourne darden, although he said gephardt has done a poor job of building on momentum gained in iowa, new hampshire and south dakota
democratic officials see dukakis, gore and jackson as the leaders
republican party officials say bush's identification with president reagan, his years of campaigning and healthy treasury put him far ahead
robertson is the wild card, with party officials unsure whether organizational strength displayed in precinct meetings earlier this month will translate into votes
gop officials claim robertson will draw dissatisified democrats to their primary, but democrats disagree and the assertion is difficult to analyze as the state does not register voters by party and there are no restrictions attached to voting in either party's primary
little polling has been done since mid-january when a newspaper survey showed bush far ahead in the republican race. the poll gave jackson a solid lead, followed by hart
an estimated 2.6 million people will be eligible to vote, although exact figures aren't available yet. blacks account for an estimated 20 percent of the registered voters
in 1984, just over 31 percent of the state's 2.4 million registered voters participated in the presidential primary, with 684,541 voting democratic and only 50,793 participating in the gop primary
but in 1980, republicans got 200,171 of the 584,951 primary votes and lee raudonis, a former state party chairman currently working for bush, predicts the party will almost double that number this year
even dukakis workers see jackson as the leader in hawaii's democratic caucuses
the way it is standing right now, jackson is in the lead with 40 percent of the people who will show up,'' said state rep. mike crozier, dukakis' state co-chairman. ``the way i see it, it'll be jackson, dukakis and uncommitted,''
although hawaii has about 30,000 democrats, the usual turnout at precinct caucuses is between 2,500 and 2,800, allowing the more than 2,000 additional members signed up by jackson's campaign to have a major impact on the results
gov. john waihee, a democrat, has urged hawaii's 28-member delegation to remain uncommitted
our view is that hawaii can provide the same impetus to jackson's campaign that west virginia did for john f. kennedy who was running as a catholic in a non-catholic state,'' said jackson state campaign chairman richard port
hawaii has very few blacks, but has a lot of people who look beyond skin color and look at the man. it's hard to overlook a man who gets support from people who aren't supporting him because he's black,'' said port. of hawaii's more than 1 million people, 2.4 percent are black
jackson, the only candidate to visit hawaii, had the backing of 17 percent of the likely democratic voters surveyed in a recent media poll. hart and dukakis both got 11 percent with gephardt and sen. paul simon each at 8 percent, and gore at 1 percent
like hawaii, only democrats are participating in idaho on super tuesday as they hold caucuses to select 18 delegates to the atlanta convention
few candidates have paid much attention to the state, with gore the only visitor
democratic party officials expect about 10,000 people to participate in the caucuses
although no polls have been conducted, observers say dukakis may have a slim lead, though he may suffer because of attempts by some party leaders to field an uncommitted delegation
analysts think dukakis has the inside track because of a superior organization that includes former gov. john evans as co-chairman
we regard it as an important statement how he does in these western states,'' said dukakis' idaho campaign director john greenfield. ``it will be an indication of his status as a national candidate.''
campaign officials for both dukakis and gore say a victory in idaho is important in their effort to dispell images as regional candidates
the republicans will hold a primary may 24 to select 18 of their national convention delegates. democrats vote again that day, but the results don't affect delegate selection
gore has worked kentucky harder than any candidate and has been endorsed by gov. wallace wilkinson. voter turnout is expected to be very low _ less than 20 percent of the 1.3 million registered democrats _ and wilkinson's organization should give gore a lift
jackson, who had a surprisingly strong showing in 1984 party caucuses, has a strong base of support among the democrats in a state with 104,640 registered black voters
gephardt has the backing of popular louisville mayor jerry abramson, while dukakis has been endorsed by former gov. martha layne collins
among republicans, bush, who has made kentucky sen. mitch mcconnell one of his national campaign chairmen, is considered the clear front-runner
a newspaper poll conducted in late january showed bush with 44 percent and dole 25 percent among the 550,000 republicans. robertson, who unsuccessfully challenged a state law prohibiting voters from changing party registration between elections, was third with 7 percent
louisiana, with 41 gop and 63 pledged democratic delegates, has attracted little attention, but officials expect that to change
i think it's coming in full force. there are a few bumper stickers around. but they're all going to pick up with their media. it's going to be mostly radio and television, depending upon their campaign,'' said state democratic chairman james brady
although no polls had been taken, brady said gore, jackson and gephardt are the early favorites. jackson won louisiana in 1984
state rep. quentin dastugue, state co-chairman for dole, predicted that dole would carry four of the state's eight congressional districts, with bush getting three and robertson one
much of early effort has involved voter registration drives, with robertson's state director claiming credit for helping to swell republican rolls by 6 percent since october
however, rep. richard baker, bush's state chairman, said the growth was due to widespread gop efforts designed to warn voters they would be locked out of the republican balloting if they remained registered democrats
i think they had made a choice to support a republican presidential candidate,'' baker said
nevertheless the gop remains drawfed more than 5-to-1 by the democrats: of the 2.2 million registered voters, 1.7 million are democrats and 328,618 republican
no crossover voting is allowed, and the 185,191 voters who registered as ``no party'' cannot participate march 8
both races appear close in maryland, a state that offers a sizable chunk of delegates: 67 democrats and 41 republicans
bush and dole are the clear gop leaders; dole had a 2 percentage point lead in a mid-february newspaper poll
most of the big-name republicans back bush, but dole has some organizational support in rural congressional districts
the democratic race has stirred little interest, although it seems likely jackson will get about 20 percent of the vote and win two predominantly black congressional districts that elect 12 of the delegates at stake election day
dukakis seems to be the overall leader, based on a strong organization, especially in the voter-rich suburbs of baltimore and washington
gephardt showed well in a newspaper poll; simon has considerable grass roots activity in some areas, particularly among school teachers; and gore has some organizational support in rural areas and in portions of the washington suburbs
the state has 1,369,597 registered democrats, 523,380 republicans and 155,343 independents. crossover voting is not permitted and registered independents are barred from the primary
massachusetts, which offers the third-highest number of delegates on super tuesday to democrats and the fourth-highest to republicans, has been virtually ignored in 1988, overshadowed by the south
by all accounts, dukakis should win a clear majority of votes in his home state, where he won re-election in 1986 with 65 percent of the vote. bush, who was born in milton, mass., and won the 1980 gop primary here, is considered the gop front-runner
i'm not sure that we're going to surprise anybody,'' said mike sentance, the gore coordinator for massachusetts. ``the gore campaign's focus is on the south, and we are more or less on our own here, battling this out with sticks and rocks.''
on the republican side, ron kaufman, the northeast coordinator for bush, was confident about his candidate's prospects, joking about bush's roots by saying, ``i think it's important that the vice president win all six of his home states.''
we're still the underdog in massachusetts,'' said dole's state co-chairman, state rep. peter torkildsen. ``quite honestly ... if we're anywhere closer than 20 points it would be a victory of sorts.''
the registration period just closed, and no new numbers were available. david sullivan, head of the state elections division, said he was hearing from town clerks of a moderate increase in independent registration. massachusetts law bans crossover voting but allows independents to vote in either primary
that could reflect several things,'' sullivan said. ``it could indicate alienation from the parties. it could indicate some democrats changing registration to independent so they can vote in the republican primary.''
jackson and gore are the front-runners among mississippi democrats, while bush appears to have a solid lead over dole and robertson among the 1.6 million mississippi voters likely to go to the polls on super tuesday. forty democratic delegates will be chosen, 31 republican
polls indicate jackson, who has made several visits to the state over the last two years, is running very strong among black voters, an estimated 37 percent of the electorate
a poll taken before the iowa caucuses feb. 8 had jackson the choice of 34 percent of the voters with hart at 18 percent and gore at 16 percent
i'd think now it would be jackson with gore gaining from what i'm hearing,'' said state democratic party chairman ed cole. ``but that could change too.''
on the gop side, the same poll had bush at 43 percent, dole at 22 and robertson at 9, but gop officials said that was before robertson's strong showings in iowa and elsewhere
state voters are free to pick the primary they want to vote in
in mississippi, you are what you say you are when you go to the polls,'' said randy patterson, chief deputy to the secretary of state
super tuesday is the first presidential primary in missouri's history, and about 800,000 people are expected to vote
democrats are banking on favorite son gephardt to pull down a majority of the 77 delegates at stake in the primary
we've had no polls but you have to know the man (gephardt) is the front-runner in missouri,'' said state democratic party chairman betty hearnes. ``we just haven't seen anybody else.''
jackson, however, is expected to make a good showing in a state with 19 percent black voters because gephardt is not particularly well-known in western missouri, away from his st. louis district
republican leaders say it's a tossup whether bush or dole will come away with a larger share of the 47 gop delegates at stake
it's keeping me on tenterhooks,'' said state gop chairman hillard selck. ``i would say it's tightsville right now. they know it's a close battle or they wouldn't be in here shuffling around like they are. both have suddenly become quite attentive to missouri.''
a month ago, state nevada democratic chairman beecher avants said the race was a tossup between dukakis and gore. now he says gore may hold a slight edge in the march 8 caucuses because of support from prominent democrats such as sen. harry reid and former gov. grant sawyer
but he said the race remains close because dukakis ``has a fairly decent base among the party regulars _ and they're the people who show up at the caucuses.''
jackson has support among nevada blacks, who represent about 7 percent of nevada's registered voters and are mainly democrats, avants says
nevada republicans held their caucuses feb. 18, and a straw poll gave bush 27 percent, although robertson backers claimed a victory by combining their 15 percent with most of a 23 percent undecided vote
there were 145,801 democrats registered to vote in nevada as of early january
north carolina is viewed widely as bush's to lose in the gop race. among democrats, jackson's extensive grassroots organization and solid base of black support may give him a plurality as dukakis, gephardt and gore fight over the remaining democratic votes
the state's 82 democratic delegates and 54 gop delegates make it one of the largest pots on super tuesday
ted arrington, university of north carolina at charlotte political scientist and a republican, says bush is running first and dole second, with robertson and kemp fighting it out for third
but he said bush is not a strong first and polls have shown changing levels of support
a newspaper poll in mid-february showed jackson leading the democrats and gaining ground with 21 percent of those polled. dukakis was second at 18 percent, gephardt 13 percent and gore 11 percent
the results were a blow to gore, who has visited often, been endorsed by sen. terry sanford and former gov. jim hunt and been running commercials for weeks
merle black, political science professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill, said jackson would get at least 90 percent of the black vote, about 19 percent of registered voters, and 5 percent to 10 percent of the white vote, leaving gore, dukakis and gephardt to fight for the rest
jackson is in a very enviable position,'' said wallace hyde, a raleigh fund-raiser and gore strategist. ``his vote i'd say is motivated. it's sort of a crusade to his people.''
the latest figures showed 2.1 million registered democrats, 850,351 republicans and 132,421 unaffiliated
spot checks show the gop is picking up some ground, and state gop chairman jack hawke says he's convinced robertson is behind much of the growth
crossover voting is not allowed in north carolina but the gop permits independents to vote in its primary. the democrats do not
gore and gephardt have been the most visible of democratic candidates in oklahoma, but party officials say the race is wide open
name id is the name of the game,'' state party chairman bill bullard said. ``i think it could boil down to who is on television delivering their message the last three days _ saturday, sunday and monday.''
bullard said the winner might have 23 percent or 24 percent of the vote. it takes 15 percent to pick up any of oklahoma's 46 delegates at stake
gephardt's call for an oil import fee is playing well in a state hit hard by the sagging fortunes of the oil industry
bush and dole are generally considered the leading republicans, but some of their supporters are nervous about robertson and his draw with many conservative democrats who have been re-registering as republican
tom cole, state gop chairman, says he thinks ``any of the three of them could win.'' jack kemp also is well organized, but thus far political experts see him finishing fourth
dole's strength is partly due to the fact that he is from kansas, a neighboring state that is heavily dependent, as is oklahoma, on agriculture
matt seward, bush campaign coordinator in oklahoma, says it is ``a neck-and-neck'' race with dole, downplaying robertson's strength despite reports that robertson supporters got more than 50 percent at february precinct meetings
eighteen of the gop 36 delegates will be chosen on the basis of the primary vote in the six congressional districts and robertson's best chances are in the heavily democratic 2nd and 3rd districts of eastern and southern oklahoma
oklahoma had 1,356,460 democrats registered as of jan. 1, compared with 616,232 republicans and 53,933 independents
county election officials have reported scores of democrats have been switching to gop to vote for robertson
dukakis and bush, with the support of party leaders and the most visible organizations, are expected to win rhode island, but each faces some competition for the 22 democratic delegates and 21 gop delegates
the massachusetts governor is a familiar face here, but rhode island democrats have a history of rejecting the establishment's choices, picking hart in 1984 and jerry brown in 1976 despite the opposition of party regulars
gore, whose organization includes a small group of legislators, and simon, who is backed by several influential labor leaders, have made a serious effort for second place
jackson won 8 percent of the vote in 1984, in a state that is only 2 percent black, but must win 15 percent to qualify for any delegates
among republicans, dole organized the state first, but bush has attracted most of rhode island's top republicans, including gov. edward d. diprete
about 514,000 voters _ there is no party registration _ are registered for the primary, virtually the same as in 1984. but since 1976, when the primary was instituted, turnout has averaged just 10.1 percent
gore is the undisputed champion in his home state, where his father was also a senator for almost two decades. only jackson has bothered to campaign for the 70 democratic delegates available and he has the support of most of the state's blacks
the republican race for 45 delegates is harder to call. bush has most of the leading republican fund-raisers and most prominent executive committee members backing him, dole has former sen. bill brock working for him but robertson is a wild card
robertson has a strong organization and bible belt appeal
state republican chairman jim henry said robertson is ``going to get 40,000 or 50,000 votes in tennessee. that will probably give him a solid third. they've identified 40,000 robertson supporters. i expect about 200,000 votes in the republican primary, about the same number who voted in '80.''
tommy harper, bush's tennessee campaign director said robertson ``is going to do pretty well,'' battling dole for second place
there were 2,466,220 registered voters at the end of 1987
there is no party registration, but estimates are that the state is about 30 percent republican, 50 percent democrat and the rest independent
texas offers the biggest slice of the super tuesday pie, with 183 democratic delegates and 111 republican delegates at stake
one-time oilman bush has adopted the state as his home, and newspaper polls show him well ahead, with robertson in third but gaining on dole
robertson may gain further from a low republican turnout on primary day
like many southern states, texas does not register by party, leaving voters free to choose either primary. in addition, texas remains a one-party state in many respects, and lots of local primary races are democrats only. this may reduce the number of people who vote in the gop presidential race, leaving the door open for robertson
bush has a solid gop establishment organization, chaired by former rep. tom loeffler and endorsed by gov. bill clements
dukakis has won raves for his organization and has moved up to the lead in at least one poll. gore, meanwhile, has picked up lots of establishment endorsements. gore also has lined up democratic fund-raiser jess hay of dallas, who put together a $750,000 night for him in dallas feb. 10. jackson has his 1984 organization in place and looks strong in inner city houston and dallas
texas has more than 7.8 million registered voters, with final counts still to be made in four of the biggest counties, including dallas and houston. registration is up 7.2 percent, boosted by a high-profile registration drive. the state does not record registration by race; however, hispanics probably make up the largest group of minority voters
secretary of state jack rains estimates as many as 1 million people will vote in each of the primaries on march 8
among virginia's democrats, jackson is ``in the driver's seat,'' said larry sabato, a university of virginia political analyst
he's got three strong, white democrats running against him (gephardt, gore and dukakis),'' sabato said. ``if all three of them stay in contention ... then jesse jackson is bound to do well. i think he's got a good chance to be the plurality winner, but not the majority winner.''
seventy-five of the virginia's 85 democratic delegates will be selected based on the primary results
republicans in virginia, robertson's home state, will select 50 delegates through a complicated series of local caucuses and district and state conventions that are not connected to the march 8 primary
steve haner, director of the gop legislative caucus in virginia, said a loss by robertson to bush in the primary might look bad, ``but after the mass meetings start, reality will set in,'' he said
three months ago, about 1,200 robertson supporters packed a western virginia arena where the state gop central committee was meeting. don moseley, a member of the committee, said it was ``an awesome display. those are very committed people, and they're not going to go away.''
washington has 2.2 million registered voters, but traditionally no more than 50,000 to 100,000 people attend the precinct caucuses. party leaders, who beat back legislation to create a presidential primary, predict they'll meet or beat the 100,000 mark this year, particularly with the infusion of robertson supporters
the caucuses are binding on the 65 democratic delegates but not for the republicans. the state has no registration by party. caucus attenders attest on a sign-in sheet that they consider themselves democrat or republican
robertson is given a good shot at edging out dole and bush, although more party regulars are predicting dole, robertson and bush finishing in that order with kemp trailing. state party chairwoman jennifer dunn, who once predicted a dole victory, now says the candidates are so bunched up she can't make a prediction
robertson is charging hard, using pastors, fundamentalists and viewers of his ``700 club'' show to recruit followers. party officials say most of the robertson supporters seem to be political neophytes
robertson state chairman bruce hawkins predicts a first- or second-place finish
both hawkins and dole spokesman brett bader say it's a robertson-dole race. dole has targeted washington more than any other candidate, going to the state eight times and locating his western coordinator there
on the democratic side, dukakis seems to have it sewed up. he's the favorite of many party regulars and has wooed labor. he made several visits, more than the others, and appears to be the favorite of gov. booth gardner
party state chairwoman karen marchioro sees simon second, followed by jackson and gore. gephart does poorly in the state, largely because of his protectionist stance in a staunchly free-trade state
everything's coming up new york at the 30th annual grammy awards, as the music industry returns to a town with a rich legacy of contributions to american song
we had a couple of choices this year,'' said ken ehrlich, producer of the show. ``we opted to downplay that it's the 30th anniversary. instead, we took advantage of what was really unique to new york. a lot of nominations are new york-based musicians and new york-oriented songs.''
the three-hour show will be telecast live on cbs-tv at 8 p.m. est on wednesday from radio city music hall. it is the first time in seven years that the presentation by the national academy of recording arts &amp; sciences will originate from new york instead of los angeles
highlighting the awards extravaganza is a production number celebrating the sounds of the city, featuring tito puente and celia cruz with their hot latin rhythms; run dmc with its funky rap; and billy joel, whose songs have traveled from downtown to uptown, from romantic greenwich village bistros to spanish harlem
it's a number that has a lot of different layers and textures,'' said ehrlich, who is producing the show for the seventh time. ``the size and the scope of the city is so big.''
guitarist-vocalist george benson will perform ``on broadway.'' new york based do-wop groups will do what they do best. do-wop
jazz legend miles davis and sax-man david sanborn will blow their horns in the art deco entertainment palace
michael jackson, suzanne vega, whitney houston, terence trent d'arby, randy travis, k.t. oslin, restless heart and comedian jackie mason will also perform
in the past few years, the grammy show has struggled for an upbeat image, moving away from the banalties of middle-of-the-road pop music. last year the accent was on blues, gospel and country music. the year before, grammy tried jazzing things up with a tribute to bebop and swing
this year the nominees range from the sensuous funk of prince to the lyrical charms of suzanne vega
fun and love still make major notes, but south africa, child abuse and national pride have claimed places on the charts as well. it seems that listeners are tired of the endless party with its synthetic orchestrations, and long for real emotions and a touch of reality backed by raw sounds and solid music
u2 sold more than 12 million copies of its grammy nominated lp, ``the joshua tree,'' with its tunes about war and the meaning of life. vega's top 10 hit, ``luka,'' a soliloquy of an abused child, has been nominated for record of the year and song of the year, and she's up for best female pop vocalist
paul simon also is nominated for record of the year for the title track from his grammy award-winning ``graceland'' lp, which fused the songwriter's poetry with the rhythms of the black township of soweto in south africa. the graceland collection won album of the year last year
up for album of the year is prince's ``sign 'o' the times,'' with its allusions to drug addiction, destitution and aids
though the rock-pop mainstream is serving up serious songs for serious listeners, frothy feelings still sell: dolly parton, linda ronstadt and emmylou harris have been nominated for album of the year for ``trio''; grammy winner whitney houston is up for her self-titled ``whitney'' lp
although women have a strong presence in the three major grammy contests, the record academy eliminated the ``best rock vocal performance, female'' category this year
i wish the nominations had been otherwise,'' ehrlich said. ``i think this has been a terrific year for women in pop music in general. i would have liked to have had more rock presence.''
the grammys have separate categories for male and female singers in pop and rhythm 'n' blues. the rock category combines them this year. tina turner, who was named best female rock vocalist last year, is nominated along with richard marx, bob seger, bruce springsteen and joe cocker
the sultry singer will not be performing in the telecast, though, because she's touring in europe
al schlesinger, president of naras, said the academy has a rule that the 6,000 industry professionals who are members must nominate 10 people in a category for that category to exist. rock vocalist nominations must be from solo albums; lead singers of groups, such as grace slick, aren't eligible
this year, naras couldn't come up with 10 female nominees for rock vocalist
other nominees range from such pop veterans as barbra streisand (``one voice'') and carly simon (``coming around again'') to jazz singer al jarreau (``moonlighting''), rhythm and blues great wilson pickett (``in the midnight hour''), country rage k.t. oslin (``80's ladies''), avant-garde rocker frank zappa (``jazz from hell'') and comedian robin williams (``a night at the met'')
grammy winners in 73 categories will be determined by balloting among the record academy members of the record academy in seven chapters nationwide. members include recording artists, songwriters, musicians, producers and technicians
the raves just roll in for the honda accord _ they have been for a number of years now _ and i have to add mine
what an utter pleasure to drive such a well-designed, well-built car. it doesn't matter who does the judging: the accord always seems to land on top
the car has been named one of the 10 best by car and driver magazine for six years _ including the current 1988 model year. this is the compact sedan that feels right to both import and domestic buyers, the magazine wrote in its january edition
popular science was no less laudatory. the accord is the best family sedan sold in the united states, the periodical said last summer. car buyers also vote in favor of the accord, having made it the third-best seller in the last model year, 1987, with sales of more than 337,000. only the ford escort and ford taurus had more sales
why is the accord so successful? the 1988 lxi sedan i drove had excellent fit and finish, one of the best ergonomically-designed interiors of any car i've been in, a responsive, fuel-injected, four-cylinder engine coupled with a smooth five-speed manual transmission and fine handling _ just to mention a few of the major items
but what really shows is honda's attention to the little things. for example, there was a small, blue light that illuminated the ignition keyhole for several seconds after the driver door was opened and closed _ just to help the driver find the spot for the key
there was a safety on the cruise control. while the set speed and resume buttons are on the four-spoke steering wheel, the button to turn on the whole system was on the dashboard to the left of the driver, so the cruise should not be activated accidentally
below the cassette player was a large center bin to keep cassettes organized. to the left of the driver was a small, shallow drawer _ ideal for coins for the parking meter. the driver-side window would go all the way down if the driver just pushed the power window button past the first stop
i didn't have to continue to hold the button down as i drove. there was a lock on the other windows, if you have children, and there were child-proof locks for the rear doors. i could go on. the accord simply has a lot of carefully-planned features. of course, they don't come cheap
the lxi is the top-of-line model and has a base price of $15,200. you could get a compact tempo gl four-door for around $9,000, in contrast. but the accord price includes a lot of amenities that are standard, such as a power moonroof with wind deflector and manual sunshade
consumer reports rates the accord highly, with the car's trouble index _ trouble experience of owners _ much better than average for the 1982-86 model years
however, i had a problem with my test car. the engine warning light came on while i was on the highway, and i limped the car (with 2,029 miles on it) back to the garage as instructed by the owner's manual, which said something may have malfunctioned in the fuel injection system. honda spokesman dave jenkins said later it was likely a loose wire, because after checking under the hood, the garage could not make the light go back on, even after 150 miles of driving
another drawback in the accord was the small rear seat. sure you can fit three adults back there, but they will sit real close together. there have been complaints of sudden acceleration in honda accords _ claims that the vehicles took off on the drivers and the brakes were not effective
honda has not found any widespread defect in the cars involved, and two federal government probes into the complaints were closed with no common malfunction found. the accord attracts a large percentage of yuppie buyers _ 46 percent are between 25 and 39 years of age
income-wise, the biggest group (18 percent) are buyers with household earnings of $30,000 to $40,000 a year. more than 70 percent of accord buyers are married, and more than 80 percent have some college education. more than 60 percent of the buyers have professional-manager type jobs, honda said
officials at many domestic automakers just drool over that kind of demographics and have spent years trying to get their vehicles to the accord's level of quality and comfort _ not to mention sales. in the cutthroat auto business, that says a lot. imitation is, after all, the sincerest form of flattery

a decision last fall by moscow to buy high-protein soybean meal from the united states is seen by an agriculture department analyst as a significant development for soviet consumers and american farmers
the sales in november, the first in eight years, totaled 1.3 million metric tons and were worth an estimated $300 million, says thomas w. bickerton of the department's economic research service
overall, the soviets are expected to import a record 3.2 million tons of soybean meal in 1987-88, including the u.s. shipments
although the soviet union has bought u.s. soybeans from time to time _ more than 813,000 tons have been sold for delivery this year _ the huge purchase of meal has special significance
underlying the decision to buy u.s. meal is soviet leader mikhail gorbachev's commitment to reform the agricultural sector, including greater profitability and more meat for consumers
the speed at which these two economic goals can be reached depends to a great extent on how quickly the soviets can introduce more protein meal into their livestock sector,'' bickerton said. ``the most cost-effective way to rapidly increase protein inputs is to sharply expand imports.''
also, he added, by adding the united states to its list of suppliers the soviets are able to see more price competition and to contract for year-round shipments
high-protein meal in feed allows livestock and poultry to do well with less grain than otherwise might be required. soybeans, after being crushed into meal and oil, are a prime source. cottonseed, sunflowerseed and other oil crops also are important
more meal in feed rations will allow the soviets to obtain greater output of meat and other livestock products at a savings,'' bickerton said in a report by the agency. ``soviet per capita meat consumption is currently only about one-half that of the united states.''
prior to last fall's orders, the soviet union last bought u.s. soybean meal in 1979, just before then-president carter imposed a partial embargo on further sales of grain and other commodities in response to the soviet invasion of afghanistan
after that, argentina, brazil and the european economic community shared the soviet market, exporting an average of 1.2 million tons of soybean meal annually
bickerton said the u.s. sales ``suggest that the soviets now feel confident in their ability to handle u.s. meal in large quantities'' and have created expectations that the soviet union will be a good customer in the future
the soviet agricultural sector lacks the resources to produce sufficient protein to bridge the existing large gap between domestic protein supply and demand,'' he said
in all, bickerton said that the soviet union's livestock protein deficit is estimated in the range of 9 million to 13 million tons a year, in soybean meal equivalent
further, he said, soviet oilseed crushing capacity ``remains stagnant'' at levels reached in the early 1970s, a factor which may have encouraged moscow to buy more meal instead of whole soybeans
another likely reason cited by bickerton for the soviet union changing its mind about u.s. soybean meal have been the marketing work done by private trade groups, including the u.s. soybean processors association and the american soybean association
still another factor was the decline in the value of the u.s. dollar against major foreign currencies, although bickerton said this has been limited in the case of soybean meal because of a rise in meal prices in the international market
bickerton said the large u.s. sales are expected to cut into the shares of the soviet market held by competitors
in 1986-87, the eec, argentina and brazil divided the soviet soybean meal market among themselves, sharing 29 percent, 34 percent and 37 percent, respectively, he said
this year, the argentine and brazilian shares may drop to a range of 20 percent to 25 percent each, and the eec could wind up with as little as 9 percent of the soviet meal business, he said
the bellows falls times described it best:
no paths, no streets, no sidewalks, no light, no roads, no guests, no calls, no teams, no hacks, no trains, no moon, no meat, no milk, no paper, no mails, no news, no thing _ but snow,'' the vermont newspaper wrote
at the time, there were 32 inches of snow on the ground _ but it was worse than that, because the winds had whipped the flakes into drifts that blanketed every house in town, covering everything but the rooftops
one two-story drift blocked the entrance to the town's only hotel. to escape, the adventurous burrowed through a narrow tunnel dug by hotel workers
no thing _ but snow
the blizzard of 1888 arrived on march 11 as a soft, gentle rain in the last days of winter. no one expected anything more; the forecasts called for clearing, balmier weather from washington to boston
three days later, the blizzard ended with corpses encased in snowbanks, telegraph and electric wires tangled, stranded commuters sleeping on hotel billiard tables, train schedules tossed to the very considerable winds, and myriad tales of heroism, tragedy, hilarity, enterprise and outright miracles
one hundred years later, the blizzard of '88 remains frozen in memory, though its remaining survivors are few. two new books mark the storm's centenary _ ``blizzard! the great storm of '88,'' by judd caplovich, and ``the blizzard of 1888,'' by mary cable
these books, along with memoirs and newspaper accounts of the time, depict a world set on its ear by the elements
some estimated accumulations: saratoga springs, n.y., 50 inches; bennington, vt., 48; blooming grove, pa., 31; pittsfield, mass., 36; new haven, conn., 45; dublin, n.h., 42
only 21 inches fell on new york city, but that is a deceptive total. in many ways, the nation's largest city was hardest hit
a great white hurricane roared all day through new york yesterday and turned the comfortable city into a wild and bewildering waste of snow and ice. ... no one living can remember such a storm,'' wrote the new york herald
a combination of 19th-century work ethic and fear of firing led thousands to make their way to their jobs
most of them had to travel on foot; horse-drawn street cars were abandoned everywhere, elevated trains stalled for hours (one train slid into another on ice-slickened tracks, killing an engineer), and cabbies charged as much as $50 a ride _ the equivalent of $600 in 1988. if they could find the way
sa-a-ay billy! where in blazes are we?'' said one hack to another, as the two cabs stood on broadway near 13th street
i'm blankety-blanked if i can see. we're near union square anyway,'' his friend replied, according to the herald
george d. baremore, a trader in hops, left his home on west 57th street and set out for his office at the battery. he walked to the sixth avenue el, waited for an hour, and then tried to walk to the ninth avenue el
he never made it. a day later, a police officer saw a hand sticking out of a drift on seventh avenue. baremore's frozen body was buried there
the most famous casualty was roscoe conkling, political powerbroker and former u.s. senator from new york. conkling refused to pay $50 forthe courts to his home on madison square
it took him more than three hours to walk 2{ miles; at one point, he was stuck in a drift for 20 minutes. he collapsed and was carried to his hotel; by the weekend, he had pneumonia and an ear infection. he died april 18
those who made it to work found they had little to do. b. altman's department store had only one customer all day _ an elderly woman who braved snow and 50-mph winds to buy two spools of thread. at tony pastor's theater, the eight performers outnumbered the audience of four. but the show went on
not surprisingly, a fair amount of partying went on. ``the smell of malt all along the line was almost enough to knock one down,'' one man recalled
the entrepreneurial spirit thrived. shovelers, most of them immigrant italians, demanded and got $10 a day. ladders were toted to elevated tracks to rescue passengers _ the ladder fee reached $2 per person. the hotels filled, and rented every bit of space _ pool tables, closets, stairwells
food and coal were in short supply. provisions, where they could be found, had to be tossed up through second-story windows. and where provisions could not be found, new yorkers made do
hundreds of sparrows took refuge under kitchen porches and were frozen or easily caught and cooked for food,'' one writer recalls
country folks adapted better; most were amply provisioned, more accustomed to dealing with the elements, less dependent on modern conveniences. this is not to say that there were no deaths: in milltown, n.j., a man went to get a doctor for his sick wife, lost his way and froze to death; by the time someone reached the house, the wife had died
in danbury, conn., a man stumbled on what appeared to be a body in the snow. he ran screaming to a saloon; the patrons emerged and began digging
when they finished, they found they had rescued a wooden cigar-store indian that had blown over in the storm
in lewes, del., 25 ships were hurled across the harbor by gale-force winds. two vessels sank
hundreds of trains were bogged down in the snow. food and drink was procured from local people where possible; when a train was mired near brookfield, conn., the stationmaster managed to scrounge enough food so that each passenger got an egg and two slices of bread
to pass the hours, some played cards, and others knitted. theatrical troupes, stuck en route to engagements, performed in the aisles; one was touring with a play entitled, ``lost in the snow.''
signs placed in snowbanks in new york: ``the flowers that bloom in the snow, ha ha'' (with a bunch of flowers). ``this way to canada.'' ``this bliz knocks biz.''
in the end, 400 people and uncounted numbers of horses and other livestock died in the blizzard, and damages were estimated at $20 million. a thaw that arrived a few days later brought flooding
the blizzard convinced new york and other cities to build subways. it also pushed utility wires in new york underground, where they remain
as the years passed, some survivors of the blizzard looked back on those days with fondness. rose b. capone of long island city, born during the snowfall, was proud of her middle name: blizzard
starting in 1929, survivors formed the society of blizzard men and women. they met yearly through the 1960s, an ever-diminishing band of snow veterans who lamented the passing of their personal ice age
we blizzard survivors are not only organizing to keep alive the traditions of the storm but we are sick and tired of all this modernity and want to go back to the days when we new yorkers lived simply and got our fun out of simple things,'' said one stalwart blizzard man
the great blizzard of 1888, which claimed 400 lives and buried the northeast in up to 55 inches of snow, probably would be less destructive if it occurred in 1988, weather experts say
from maine to the nation's capital, much of the u.s. population came to a halt beginning march 11, 1988. by the time the storm ended, 72 hours after it started, about 400 people were dead, 200 in new york city alone
the official weather forecast, issued by the war department's signal service, had called for brisk winds and fair weather over the atlantic states when the brunt of the storm struck
today, classic ``northeasters'' of the type that caused the 1888 storm are easier to predict, with satellite photos and complex communications able to track the storms as they form in the south and churn along the atlantic coast, collecting moisture to dump as snow in the middle atlantic and northeast states
using satellites and detailed computer models, forecasters today should be able to give two days warning of such a storm, said harlan saylor, deputy director of the national meteorological center in camp springs, md
in addition, he added, federal weather forecasters now work 24 hours a day, every day. in 1888, forecast offices closed on weekends. on the weekend the blizzard began, the new york forecaster closed the office on saturday afternoon
today, too, the effect of even a massive storm like that a century ago, a storm that buried troy, n.y. under 55 inches of snow and dumped 40 inches on bennington, vt., should prove less dangerous to most americans, according to weather historian david m. ludlum
one facet is that new york has subways now and people could get about. the blizzard was one of the reasons that speeded up building subways,'' he said in a telephone interview from his princeton, n.j., office
indeed, trains stuck on new york city's elevated railways posed a major problem in 1888, with passengers often having to be evacuated on rickety wind-whipped ladders
judd caplovich in the book, ``blizzard! the great storm of '88,'' said the storm prompted many cities to turn to electric streetcars, instead of the popular horse-drawn versions
in another change at least partly spurred by the blizzard, ludlum noted that today communications lines are underground
in 1888, horsepower was the best that was available to clear snow, now we have motor vehicles, of course,'' he added
but, ludlum said, ``the automobile adds another factor, which would make things a lot tougher because they can't get around unless it's plowed.''
travel might not be as necessary now, since most people have refrigerators and freezers to store food and central heating is available
a hundred years ago, city residents lacked convenient food storage and most city families relied on daily trips to the market for supplies. markets depended on regular deliveries to keep stock in place
farmers often were better off than their city cousins, at least able to survive the isolation with stored food
adding to the misery was cold, and the fact that for many families heat depended on a coal stove, replenished by fuel bought in a daily bucket from now closed and snowed-in stores
a century ago workers who missed a day on the job lost pay, and could well find their place filled by someone else when they did return _ there was little or no employment security
the result was that thousands took to the streets on that frightening monday, trudging to jobs or to try and find coal for heat or milk for the baby _ and for many it was their last trip
today, many businesses _ and even the federal government _ close at the first hint of bad weather
eventually, patrick hughes wrote in the magazine ``weatherwise,'' the storm ``proved a financial blessing to the city's poor. any man or boy able to lift a shovel was able to make at least double the normal laborer's wages. street car companies, street cleaning agencies and many private organizations were giving work to all at $2 or more a day.''
though plows are available today, they still haven't eliminated the need for the hand-driven shovel
adding to the confusion during the 1888 storm was the lack of communication as the hurricane-strength winds ripped down overhead telegraph lines connecting major cities
foreign invaders could have come ashore at annapolis or baltimore during the blizzard of '88. officials in the nation's capital would have been unaware and probably unable to do anything about it,'' caplovich wrote
he noted too that the blizzard brought ``white monday'' to the new york stock exchange. only five stocks were traded that day, volume totaling 15,200 shares. the next day only 2,000 shares changed hands
today, electronic signals easily pierce clouds and snow to carry news and financial orders from city to city, unlike 1888 when new york could still communicate with london via the atlantic cable, but not nearby cities
the same storm today, though likely less damaging, could still cause chaos. major storms in new york in 1947 and boston in 1978 caused serious dislocations, for example, ludlum said
but they weren't the same
there has been more snow, but never the combination of low temperatures, high winds and blowing snow. we've never had drifts quite like '88,'' ludlum said. jackson</head>
for jesse jackson and his deep south campaign army, super tuesday may well be a victory march that began on a bridge on bloody sunday
black marchers seeking the right to vote were routed by alabama troopers on the bridge at selma on what became known as bloody sunday, march 7, 1965. as that anniversary approaches, black voters are now forming ranks across dixie to make super tuesday, march 8, 1988, a landmark march to the ballot box
political and campaign officials say jackson, the black candidate for the democratic presidential nomination, could win six states _ alabama, mississippi, louisiana, georgia, virginia and north carolina _ with some whites joining his core of black support
they say he possibly could run first in arkansas, may be in the top two in maryland, and likely will run among the leaders qualifying for rich numbers of delegates in the south's big bookend states of texas and florida
february is black history month,'' says rose sanders, a black who brought her harvard law school degree back to handle civil rights work in selma. ``we're telling young people to make super black history on super tuesday.''
eleven southern states with double-digit black voting percentages are among 20 that hold primaries or caucuses march 8. a 12th, south carolina, jackson's home state, holds democratic caucuses four days after super tuesday. more than 900 democratic national convention delegates are at stake among this dixie dozen, with jackson in position to claim perhaps a third or more
that would delight his followers and also disturb his critics who see him as an unelectable candidate threatening to fracture his party. it will take 2,081 delegates to win the nomination at the convention in atlanta, far more than any campaign operatives or political observers see jackson cornering
rivals such as sen. albert gore jr., who is expected to win overwhelmingly in his native tennessee, are angling for their share of the southern delegates. massachusetts gov. michael dukakis and missouri rep. richard gephardt _ whose home states are also in the super tuesday lineup _ are counting on scores of delegates from super tuesday states such as texas as well as those inside and outside the south
but while the final mix may be confusing, sonia jarvis, executive director of the national coalition on black voter participation in washington, said super tuesday likely will be a showcase for jackson, particularly if he continues to draw white voters to his cause
i think he will be very hard to beat in at least half the primaries,'' she said
jackson is in a very enviable position,'' said wallace hyde of raleigh, a gore strategist, discussing north carolina. ``you'd have to say he is the favorite. his vote, i'd say, is motivated. it's sort of a crusade to his people.''
he's got three strong, white candidates running against him,'' said larry sabato, a university of virginia political analyst, reviewing that state's outlook. ``if all three of them stay in contention for the three weeks of the campaign, then jesse jackson is bound to do well. i think he's got a good chance to be the plurality winner, but not the majority winner.''
jarvis said that in jackson's first run for the presidency in 1984 his vote generally matched up with the percentage of black voters. ``it wasn't always true, but that was the pattern,'' she said
now in such states as iowa, new hampshire and minnesota, states with small black voter percentages, jackson has added white votes in numbers that have elated his campaign
he is not just the blacks' candidate,'' said sanders. ``he's the people's candidate. finally there are some whites in this country beginning to recognize this.''
martin moe, a white who graduated last year from oberlin college in ohio, came out of jackson's national campaign office in chicago to work for the candidate in iowa and more recently help organize in alabama, where jackson has targeted disenchanted whites, including the poor, laid-off labor and beleaguered farm voters, as well as blacks
jackson is significantly broadening the base of his support,'' said moe
but some blacks felt wounded by 1984, when a number of black leaders sided with walter mondale and party rules rankled the jackson campaign
this time there is more of a wait-and-see approach among black voters as opposed to the fervor of the first time around,'' said jarvis. black voters, she said, seem to be saying, ``let's see what they do with jackson this time around ... then we'll see how active we'll be.''
state rep. charles young of meridian, vice chairperson of the black caucus in mississippi, said he senses no apprehension that the democratic party won't play fair with jackson. for most blacks, he said, the feeling is ``let's deal with the situation as it comes.''
the question looming now for the jackson campaign is not whether he will make history on super tuesday but what happens once that bridge is crossed, especially if he should arrive in atlanta with none of his rivals having locked up the nomination
whatever the results,'' said robert james jr., a north alabama jackson campaign official, ``this country will never be the same again poliltically.''
the television networks like to head into the presidential primary season armed with polls and research and a pretty good notion of what's going to happen and, therefore, how to cover it
but the networks seem bewildered by the challenge of the march 8 ``super tuesday'' primaries and caucuses, with multiple candidates in both parties seeking delegates in 20 states from one end of the country to the other, not to mention american samoa
i think we're just now realizing the degree of difficulty,'' said nbc correspondent dennis murphy, who was on the campaign trail in atlanta last week
i've got gephardt in south dakota today. jesse is in, i think, the carolinas,'' he said. ``you've got dukakis at the statehouse. gephardt is on his way to texas from south dakota. we've got crews strung out with these guys all over the map
i think it's as hard for them as it is for us,'' murphy said. ``they can't put charters together to carry us in any convenient fashion, so we've been chasing gephardt around south dakota in a lear jet. it's like $10,000-a-day coverage. so it's difficult to bring all the stuff into one place and stay on top of coverage.''
two weeks before super tuesday, cbs and nbc decided the results were likely to be so muddled that they had erred in expecting to spend all of prime time _ in cbs' case, and two hours of it, in nbc's _ on the results. both cut their prime-time coverage by an hour. abc was still planning two hours
there is also a new austerity at the scaled-down network news divisions that rules out coverage of every candidate every day _ the modus operandi in previous presidential years
it's a killer, there's no question,'' said cbs senior political producer richard cohen. ``it's just as much a killer for the candidates as it is for us, because there's so much ground to cover ... we can't be 100 percent sure we're going to be everywhere we want to be and not miss anything.''
there's a lot of head scratching,'' said abc correspondent jeff greenfield. ``i always delight in that, because i think the more that the people break out of the pattern that the press presumes to impose, the healthier it is politically. i like the fact that we have to wait for people to vote before we can rush in and say, `ah ha!'''
the networks plan to treat the night of super tuesday itself like a mini-general election. cbs and nbc will have anchors in new york for prime-time specials
it is really much more like a national election than a primary,'' said greenfield. ``what makes it interesting is it's a national election not with two candidates but with seven or eight. so it's going to pose a heck of a challenge to begin to make these distinctions clear to the viewers and readers.''
cnn will base its anchors in atlanta, its headquarters, and spend most of prime time on the results
on pbs, ``the macneil-lehrer newshour'' will close up relatively early on tuesday night, then get spend wednesday night assessing the results
laughed associate editor jim lehrer, ``i can wait until the results come and then say, `hmmm, isn't that interesting.' i feel sorry for some of my colleagues. they have to act like they know what the hell's going on. i think it's just an act, because it is so new and there are so many different factors.''
the networks say this year's election is providing an opportunity to reassess the way they cover politics, such as doing more big-picture stories than the usual accounting of the day's events on the campaign trail
nbc's murphy, for instance, assigned to the democrats, eschewed tailing gephardt in favor of a broader story examining the trade issue
it may look a little less here-they-come-there-they-go campaign-like from the kind of stuff that we filed in the past, which would be just fine with me,'' murphy said. ``how much can you say about the guy at a staged photo event, any one of these people?''
the 1988 elections could change not only the way campaigns are covered, but how campaigns are run. for years, the news media have, in effect, subsidized the candidates' chartered airplanes by paying 1{ times the cost of a first-class ticket to ride from campaign stop to stop
campaigns counted on the networks sending a reporter and camera crew around after the candidate. this year, however, with too many candidates and too little money, networks are going to so-called ``zone coverage'' as opposed to ``man-to-man'' coverage, having correspondents like murphy cover multiple candidates and larger issues and relying on local affiliates for standard campaign-stop coverage

angela sanbrano was a student in law school and working on immigration cases in a legal clinic in 1980. she kept running into women from el salvador who said they had been tortured. ``i wondered how we could try and stop this,'' she says
leslie schuld was a student at the univesity of dayton in ohio in 1981 when she saw a film on the violence in el salvador. she says she started reading the troubled history of that troubled country
jon haines was working as an aide in a nursing home in seattle. ``in 1981, it looked like the united states would be getting more invlved in el salvador, and i was really concerned about that,'' he says
these people were drawn to an organization which was just coming into being at the time _ cispes, the committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador
so was the fbi _ twice. in a case which recalls the excesses of the communist-hunting days of the 1950s that led to restrictions on fbi investigations into political activity, the bureau has come under criticism for the way it infiltrated cispes and employed an informer for more than three years who, the fbi now says, supplied ``disinformation and misinformation.''
the first time the fbi investigated cispes it suspected it was operating as a foreign front. the second time, it suspected cispes was engaging in terrorism and had ``cells'' of members planning to commit violence and sabotage
but the upshot was embarrassment, and a new round of qustions about the bureau's squeaky clean image under former director william webster, now the head of the cia
the senate intelligence committee already has conducted one hearing into the fbi's conduct and the house panel that oversees the fbi plans to hold hearings as well
at issue is whether the fbi went too far in conducting domestic surveillance of cispes, violating the first amendment rights of group members to express their political opinions
or as sen. howard metzenbaum, d-ohio, a member of the senate intelligence committee, put it, ``the issues we're talking about go to the very heart of the confidence the american people have in the fbi.''
why did the fbi conduct two investigations of cispes over a five-year period if, in fact, the group was merely one of hundreds in the united states that work to bring about change in american foreign policy?
the associated press interviewed members of cispes and reviewed the 2,000 pages of fbi documents, many partially or totally blacked out by government censors. they were provided in response to a freedom of information request to the center for constitutional rights in new york. the fbi gave its first detailed explanation of its investigation in a report to the senate intelligence committee on tuesday
the story begins in october 1980, with the founding of cispes at conferences in los angeles and washington
the fbi claims that it obtained a document, reportedly seized from the communist guerillas in el salvador, indicating that the communist party in the united states was involved in the establishment of cispes
specifically, the fbi says farid handal, the brother of the head of the salvadoran communist party, met with sandra pollock, a member of the central committee of the communist party in the united states, in march 1980 to work out a way of getting financial and moral support for the salvadoran guerrillas. cispes was that way, the fbi contends
beth perry, a spokeswoman for cispes who attended the founding conference in los angeles, acknowledged in a recent interview that handal did attend the meeting
people knew he was a member of the communist party,'' perry said. ``handal put out his opinions in discussions. we listened because we were interested in all salvadorans' opinions. but dominating, he wasn't.''
perry said pollock attended the east coast conference in washington, and ``just like farid's, hers was just one voice. in terms of this is the (communist party) line, absolutely not. in terms of what we ought to do, absolutely not.''
at the time, the violence in el salvador was in the news almost daily. one news story at the end of 1980 declared that the civil war in the central american nation had taken 8,500 lives that year
less than two months after cispes' founding, three roman catholic nuns and a lay worker were killed and buried in a roadside grave. the sisters were in el salvador to aid refugees from rural areas who were fleeing the violence between leftist and rightist guerillas
when i was getting the testimony from these people for filing their immigration papers, i learned of what these people had gone through in el salvador,'' said sanbrano, the law student who was working on immigration cases in 1980. ``some of the women had been involved in starting unions. they talked about how they had been tortured, and it really touched me. i wondered how we could try and stop this.''
she joined cispes as a volunteer and worked her way up to southwest regional coordinator in 1983 to national coordinator in 1985. she was re-elected to the top spot in 1987, with the new title, executive director
she said the group has two main objectives _ ``to change u.s. policy in el salvador from a militaristic policy to a political-diplomatic policy and to allow central americans to determine their own destiny.''
being in solidarity with the people of el salvador means we support their struggle for peace and justice and work with them to win that struggle,'' she said. ``solidarity means to take someone else's struggle and make it your own.''
sanbrano, who is of mexican origin, said cispes ``openly supports'' the communist guerillas, known as the frente farabundo marti de liberacion nacional, or fmln. but she said the support is not financial. ``we believe they are a legitimate political organization in el salvador.''
the fbi, in its report on the cispes investigation, says the fmln is responsible for numerous terrorist activities, including the may 1983 assassination of navy lt. cmdr. albert a. schaufelberger, who was the u.s. military adviser in el salvador
perry, the spokeswoman for cispes, agreed that the fmln has killed americans. ``we don't want to see anyone killed, but there's a civil war going on there. people get caught in a war.''
she later added, ``we feel americans should not be there. if the united states got out of el salvador, no americans would be killed.''
no one in cispes interviewed by the ap recalled any violent actions ever being discussed at meetings. all said there no secret ``cells'' of members planning terrorist actions. and all generally gave the same report of activities in their area by cispes, ranging from petition drives to demonstrations to inviting speakers to their meetings. two described their meetings as ``long and boring.''
sanbrano said cispes also does a lot of fund-raising, much of it going to running the group and producing newsletters and other literature. she said she gets a salary of $865 a month, as do most of the full-time workers for cispes
some of the money the group raises does go for humanitarian aid and for agricultural projects in el salvador, she said, ``but we don't fund the fmln.''
although the cispes members interviewed had different reasons for joining the group, all said they joined to bring about a change in u.s. policy in central america
leslie schuld, the university of dayton student, now midwest regional director of cispes, joined the group in 1981. she said the film shown by a local chapter of cispes on the violence in el salvador shocked her. she said she read up on the history of el salvador and on u.s. involvement in central america and went to work as a volunteer for cispes
jon haines, the nursing home aide, joined at about the same time. he said he was growing increasingly concerned about u.s. involvement in el salvador. ``in 1981, it looked like the united states would be getting more involved in el salvador, and i was really concerned about that,'' he said
in dallas, parker wilson was a legal counsel to sears. ``i remember having a general concern about the central america situation and our government's actions,'' he said. he joined the local chapter of cispes, which he described as ``a little, scraggly group'' in the early 1980s. it held meetings in a catholic church
not long after the dallas chapter was formed, the fbi hired a former evangelist from el salvador, frank varelli, to inform on the group. varelli began work on march 10, 1981, according to his testimony last year to the house judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights
for more than three years, he testified to the house panel, he told the fbi what it wanted to hear. he told the fbi that cispes' activities were being directed by the salvadoran guerillas and that members of cispes were engaged in international terrorism or were knowingly helping those engaged in terrorism
the fbi says it began its first investigation of cispes on sept. 3, 1981, at the justice department's request. in its report to the senate intelligence committee, the fbi says it was asked to determine whether cispes was supplying money and material to the communist guerillas in el salvador and, therefore, should register under the foreign agents registration act
oliver b. revell, fbi executive assistant director, told the intelligence panel, that the probe was ``just a records check,'' and it was closed on feb. 23, 1982
the fbi opened its second investigation of cispes on march 30, 1983, largely on the basis of varelli's information, the fbi says in its report to the senate intelligence committee. this was a counterterrorism investigation, which gives the fbi far more sweeping powers than the first probe. it requires only that there be probable cause to suspect a terrorist threat to justify domestic surveillance
varelli continued working as an informer for the fbi for more than three years, telling it in 1984 that members of cispes were plotting to assassinate president reagan and disrupt the republican national convention in dallas. he stopped working for the fbi in august 1984 and in march 1986 filed suit to get the rest of the pay he felt he was owed for his fbi work. the case is still pending
the fbi closed its investigation of cispes on june 18, 1985, because, revell said, ``we found insufficient evidence to continue. ... part of the reason for that was the disinformation and misinformation supplied by mr. varelli.''
wilson, of the dallas chapter, said he considers the fbi infiltration of the group ``so peculiar. the organization has always been open to anyone who wanted to come. there was no need for infiltration.''

north florida farmer fred williams has an analysis of the super tuesday primaries across the south and elsewhere: ``there are too many hogs in the creek and the water is muddy.''
little more than a week from the regionwide presidential primaries in both parties, his farm analogy remains apt. the picture in both parties hasn't entirely cleared, and the races remain crowded
super tuesday, the closest the nation has ever come to a national primary, could crystallize the nomination races, particularly on the republican side. but there's as much likelihood it won't
pat robertson is a wild card that threatens to confuse the republican race. he has the opportunity to do well, maybe even win, in some small-turnout primaries in areas where he built devoted followings through years as a television evangelist
and if no democrat strongly emerges, that race may not come close to being decided on march 8 and the field will move on to the next round of northern industrial states, still crowded with three or four candidates
super tuesday is not fulfilling the wishes of its founders,'' said university of virginia political scientist larry sabato
twenty states hold democratic primaries or caucuses on tuesday, march 8, and they stretch from massachusetts to florida to idaho; there are 17 gop contests. the day is mainly southern, with 14 contests in southern or border states. democrats also hold a caucus in american samoa
at stake are 1,307 democratic and 712 republican delegates _ about one-third the total in both parties
southern legislators set the whole thing up with the aim of providing a conservative or moderating influence on the democratic nomination process, countering and perhaps stealing the thunder of earlier contests. the gop went along, often because democrats control the legislatures in those southern states
the primary may yet move the democratic nominee to the right. but it didn't diminish the early contests. wins in iowa and new hampshire have helped propel richard gephardt and michael dukakis in polls of the south
and so far no single democrat has emerged with broad appeal across the south _ the region democrats agree they must carry to regain the white house
among the republicans, the south looks like george bush territory. president reagan has always been popular there and the vice president has successfully _ so far at least _ managed to appear the heir. polls show him leading dole two-to-one or better in the region
he has the added benefit of a southern organization regarded as unsurpassed. but all those strengths looked as thin as the paper they were written on when bush appeared on the verge of losing new hampshire to sen. bob dole
bush won, of course, but dole, robertson and new york rep. jack kemp hope to attack bush's base and prove it broad but thin
kemp needs to do well somewhere in the south to be able to sustain his campaign and the argument that he is the conservative alternative
robertson, who became known across the south and elsewhere as host of the ``700 club'' program on his own religious cable network, has drawn a line in the dirt of south carolina. he needs to win somewhere, and he says that's where it will be
south carolina isn't a super tuesday state; its gop caucuses are three days earlier. but it is being watched
bush has organizational and institutional strength there. but robertson contends the state is fertile ground for him too. its gop primary usually has a low voter turnout, and crossover democratic voting is allowed _ a made-to-order formula for robertson's strength based in fundamentalist churches
dole is contesting the state, too, but could finish third. dole must pick his shots and concentrate in areas where he can profit under the gop's winner-take-all rules in many congressional districts and states
should robertson produce victories in the south, the gop race could prove a prolonged and bitter fight with bush, dole and robertson. but robertson must still demonstrate he has appeal beyond his evangelical base and can be more than a disruptive force for the gop
jesse jackson leads in the polls in many southern states and is certain to do well in states with heavy black voting populations. he wants to do well in the south but will go on to the convention in atlanta this summer regardless
he's going to have enough votes to play somebody's fiddle,'' said williams, the grand ridge, fla., farmer who backs jackson. ``they'll trade for votes just like we trade pigs and cows.''
dukakis has run well in some southern polls and has a good organization in many states. as governor of massachusetts, he carries the image of a liberal state that triggers opposition in many southern quarters
there is just an innate fear of somebody from massachusetts,'' said louisiana democratic chairman james brady. ``they're associated with tip o'neill and teddy kennedy.''
but dukakis hopes to win florida, where he has strong support in the southern end of the state, and perhaps texas too. with massachusetts voting that day as well he could be the big delegate winner
sen. albert gore jr. of tennessee has tried to position himself to the right of the democratic field, depicting the rest as liberal ``peas in a pod.'' he must do well across the region, and polls have shown him running as high as second and as low as fourth in the region
rep. richard gephardt, winner in iowa and south dakota, is also attracting conservative and moderate democratic voters in some states with his well-honed appeal to concerns about foreign competition and a message that america is in economic decline
he has shown strength among blue-collar voters, and so far has concentrated his effort in the economically hard-hit energy-producing states of the south, where his call for an oil-import fee is a further boost. a texas poll had him leading that huge delegate state but falling back after dukakis won new hampshire
sen. paul simon of illinois has no visible southern strength. gary hart appears to be fading
with so broad a field and so many contests, how will we know who wins super tuesday?
florida and texas are the big prizes, and if a candidate carries both of those, it will be hard for anyone else to argue they won super tuesday, although some no doubt will
as the nomination race moves on, delegates are what matters. massachusetts has the next biggest democratic total, and dukakis figures to get most of them. jackson, too, will get a big share of southern delegates
still another measure will be the cross-over voting. it is allowed in eight of southern and border super tuesday states _ alabama, arkansas, georgia, mississippi, missouri, tennessee, texas and virginia
a big republican primary vote in those states, at the cost of democratic votes, could be a harbinger for the fall
in the hometown of the 39th president, where politics was once the driving energy, the kountry korner is the place to go for coffee, catfish and gossip
eavesdrop there and you will hear table talk about mildred wise's hand crocheted bedspread, the before-and-after beauty treatment pictures of cathy williams on page 124 in the current ``good housekeeping,'' mayor ralph mcdonald's recent illness, the prospects for bass and bream, and unvarnished views on errant tv evangelists
but if hot insight into the super tuesday primaries is the object of your eavsdropping, you eavesdrop in vain
i don't know why people aren't talking about super tuesday,'' marlene dozier, the kountry korner's chief cook and part owner, was saying the other day.``i suppose they aren't much interested
when is it?''
at least one plains citizen with that famous name knows when it is. in fact, hugh carter, the former president's cousin, has already voted
i'm going to be away march 8 so i went ahead and marked my absentee ballot,'' hugh carter said, bending over a stack of books with a felt tip pen
and?
gore. i voted for albert gore.''
hugh carter, too, has not observed any stirring interest among his townspeople in the primary. none of the democrats seeking the presidential nomination has seen fit to make plains a campaign stop. and jimmy carter, who still maintains a home here, has studiously refrained from saying which of the democrats he personally favors for the presidential nomination
nonetheless, hugh carter believes the turnout of plains' 265 eligible voters will be strong
we have to vote at the same time on a county tax increase. that'll get 'em out.''
hugh carter, seven-term state senator, author, ``antiques'' dealer and worm raiser, is the town's leading purveyor of jimmy carter souvenirs
you can pick up a plains souvenir from the kountry korner cashier, or at the drug store or the peanut gallery, which also sells gas, but hugh carter's emporium, for pure variety of ball points, salt shakers, paperweights and postcards, outdoes anything at the grand canyon or niagara falls
people come to plains they want something to take home, show they've been here,'' he said
the one item he hopes all visitors will take home is a copy of his book about the carter family, ``cousin beedie and cousin hot.'' a huge sign out front promises that every copy will be autographed. he also sells, it appears, every scrap of writing ever written by every carter who ever lived
but business is a far cry from what it once was
before jimmy carter was elected president, his brother, billy, described plains, a town of 687 then as now, as a place where a hound dog could lie down in the middle of main street on saturday night and sleep unharmed at least until monday morning
then, during the early presidential years, visitors came in droves, hordes, sometimes 20,000 or more a day, so many, hugh carter recalls, that they had to hire nine policemen just to direct traffic
now plains is back to three cops, one on duty at a time, and except for an occasional tour bus that hound dog would be safe all week
the old depot, which served as carter's 1976 campaign headquarters, was recently designated a national historic site along with carter's boyhood home and high school. all are models of life in the rural south in another era
we're hoping, of course, that the historic site designation will bring more tourists,'' says annie mae vaughn, a volunteer, putting down her book when a visitor entered the depot. the vaughns and carters have been neighbors for three generations
nothing remotely connected with carter is overlooked as a possible tourist attraction. a self-guided tour booklet lists 25 places of interest: jimmy's church, his former church, the post office where he mails his letters, his mother's home, his brother's home, his grandmother's home, his wife's brother's home, the home where his parents had an apartment when they first married
was that where jimmy carter was born?
no,'' said hugh carter. ``jimmy was born in a hospital. but don't you see? that's where he was conceived.''
back at the kountry korner, which is not on the list but is where every tourist stops, the proprietor had a second thought about the coming primary election
i do remember a lady who was in here the other day and mentioned super tuesday,'' said marlene dozier. ``she was from canada.''
united mine workers president richard trumka says he considers the union's failed merger with the oil, chemical and atomic workers union ``a closed deal'' that won't be reconsidered
ocaw's executive board on tuesday voted 6-2 to reject a merger that would have created the united mine, energy and chemical workers of america from the two powerful unions
trumka said wednesday the ocaw board had left open the possibility of reconsidering the merger, but the umw's board voted wednesday to rescind the approval it gave on sunday
a federal judge has given the environmental protection agency until april 15 to ban the sale and commercial use of products containing an anti-termite pesticide believed to cause cancer
u.s. district judge louis oberdorfer ruled wednesday that the epa had acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federal pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of products containing the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor
oberdorfer said epa failed to take into account whether continued sale or use of the products ``would pose any unreasonable risk to man or the environment.''
a new blood test for aids antibodies virtually eliminates the false positive readings that needlessly terrorize healthy people, the test's creator claims
smithkline bio-science laboratories said wednesday it would perform the confirmatory tests at its own lab for $80 apiece, about the same price as the tests they are intended to replace. it said the service was available immediately
doctors familiar with the new test said it was a major advance
a new ``condom for females'' pioneered in europe will be tested this spring in the united states, and developers predicted it would be a major weapon in the fight against aids and other sexually transmitted diseases
the new disposable contraceptive, made of polyurethane, resembles a condom but is worn by women, researchers said wednesday as they unveiled the device
president reagan says the decline in the value of the dollar has opened opportunities for u.s. exporters but they could be undermined by protectionist legislation congress is considering
the fact that the dollar's exchange rate is at a far more realistic level is of great significance'' to the market for u.s. exports, the president said wednesday to members of export now, a public-private group organized by the commmerce department
gold prices tumbled wednesday as traders appeared to take a more optimistic view of chances for continued low inflation. the dollar was mixed in foreign exchange
the stock market was little changed. the dow jones average of 30 industrials edged up 0.83 to 2,039.95
bond prices edged lower. grain and soybean futures settled mostly higher, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures retreated; and stock-index futures declined
a new test that identifies aids virus antibodies in blood is dramatically reducing the incidence of inconclusive tests for evidence of the deadly disease, its maker says
inconclusive results of aids tests can be terrifying for patients because they raise the possibility of infection, smithkline bio-science laboratories said wednesday in announcing immediate availability of the new test
known as hivagen, the new test also virtually eliminates false positive readings, which are already uncommon under current testing procedures for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the philadelphia-based company said
this test is a quantum leap forward in aids testing,'' john mills, chief of infectious diseases at san francisco general hospital, said in a statement released by smithkline
mills performed clinical trials on the value of hivagen as a replacement for the western blot assay, the current standard test for blood samples that flunk mass screenings
smithkline said it would perform the tests at its own lab for $80 apiece, about the same price as the western blot assay
false positive readings, even though they represent a small fraction of tests, have become more common because aids antibody testing itself has become more common
about 29 million people will be screened for aids antibodies this year, and about 500,000 will be referred for further tests, smithkline officials estimated. the company said false positive readings might range as high as 5 percent on certain inferior versions of the western blot assay, commonly used for further testing
in response, du pont co. said its own widely used version of the western blot assay produces virtually no false positives because the company has an extremely strict standard for what constitutes a positive reading
smithkline officials conceded the du pont test, the only one licensed by the food and drug administration for blood donor screening, produces few if any false positives
with the hivagen test, false positive readings simply cannot occur, company officials asserted. but some scientists were cautious
it may well be that this represents a substantial advance, but you wonder whether it can really be perfect,'' said dr. klemens meyer, an internist and decision analyst at new england medical center in boston, who said he had no first-hand knowledge of hivagen
the presence of aids antibodies does not necessarily mean a person has the disease. the most recent studies have shown that 30 percent to 40 percent of people with aids antibodies have later developed the disease, although many doctors believe that percentage will rise eventually
smithkline has applied for patents on the synthetic molecules used in the hivagen test, said martin rosenberg, vice president of biopharmaceutical research and development
in tests of more than 2,500 blood samples at san francisco general hospital, hivagen was inconclusive in 2.5 percent to 4.2 percent of the patients, vs. 15.6 percent to 18 percent inconclusive results for the western blot assay, said dr. john mills, the hospital's chief of infectious diseases
in another test of the blood of volunteers, the hivagen test was accurate for all 225 people who did not have the aids antibody and was accurate in 135 of the 136 patients without symptoms who did have the aids antibody. in the lone exception, the test was inconclusive, mills said
other companies also have introduced or are working on better tests for aids, including cetus corp. of emeryville, calif., which is developing a test for aids virus genes, and cambridge bioscience corp. of worcester, mass., which has applied for regulatory approval for an antibody test
the hivagen test does not require fda approval because the technology is not for sale to others, groome said. however, fda officials are aware of the test and have invited a smithkline scientist to speak on the subject at a conference next week in washington, he said
when plans for a national energy union fizzled, united mine workers president richard trumka said he started looking for other ways to expand his union's influence
we're going to pursue a policy of growth for our organization,'' trumka said wednesday after the oil chemical and atomic workers international union and the umw rejected a merger agreement that would have created the united mine, energy and chemical workers of america
i spent four or five hours last night with pencil and paper trying to work out ways to expand our union,'' trumka said
trumka said he considers the failed merger ``a closed deal'' that won't be reconsidered, although ocaw spokesman rod rogers said his union doesn't necessarily agree
it's always possible there could bea resurrection of the idea,'' he said
there were compelling reasons why this merger was a good idea, and those reasons haven't gone away,'' rogers said. ``this particular merger proposal is dead, yes, but we could take action to re-initiate things.''
trumka said he was ready to look elsewhere to expand, however
i'll come back at the next (umw) board meeting and say, `that didn't work; let's try something else,''' trumka said
the proposal for a merger between the two energy unions, which each claim about 100,000 active members, was rejected tuesday by ocaw's executive board on a 6-2 vote, largely because it wanted assurances there would be no dues increase, trumka said. the umw then rescinded the approval it gave sunday
trumka said both unions would continue to work together, especially on negotiations with common employers
while he plans to look for other ways to expand the umw's influence, trumka said, he said he did not consider it good policy ``to merge just for the sake of merging.''

automaking giant general motors corp., which a year ago was wallowing in lotfuls of unsold cars, is showing signs of resurgence because of higher demand for profitable models and an aggressive sales-incentive campaign
the biggest u.s. automaker announced wednesday that it will add about 130,000 cars and 45,000 trucks to previously trimmed 1988 production plans and recall 8,600 employees at four factories
the expansion will be made via restoration of second shifts at three plants, reopening of a closed plant in framingham, mass., and running some plants on overtime
the strengthening demand for gm vehicles reflects the ongoing product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and employee involvement programs,'' gm president robert stempel said in a statement
this combined with very competitive retail incentive programs has increased the value of gm products,'' he said
at the three plants where gm had dropped the second shift, workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating between two weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job, gm said
the framingham assembly plant, which gm closed abruptly nov. 30, will reopen may 9 on one shift with 2,000 of its 3,700 workers. the plant will build the oldsmobile cutlass cierra, but will not resume production of the chevrolet celebrity, gm spokeswoman kathy tanner said
gm will restore the second shift at its buick-oldsmobile-cadillac group assembly plant in lansing, mich., april 11, returning 2,000 people to full-time work. the 4,350-worker plant builds the oldsmobile cutlass calais and buick skylark
the second shift at gm's 4,200-worker van nuys, calif., assembly plant will be restored march 14, bringing 1,900 employees back full time. the plant, which is gm's only chevrolet camaro and pontiac firebird source, dropped the second shift last week
gm also will restore the second shift at its oshawa no. 1 plant in oshawa, ontario, bringing back 2,700 laid-off workers on march 21. the plant builds the oldsmobile cierra and pontiac 6000
the company said it would increase production at the cadillac plant in the detroit enclave of hamtramck by running its single shift on overtime, adding 4,700 cars between feb. 20 and june 1
cadillac general manager john grettenberger said the increased production was necessary because dealers need more of the restyled eldorado coupe and seville sedans, enjoying high popularity due to a new engine model
gm's expansion plans contrast sharply to the same time about a year ago, when it suffered slumping sales, a three-month backlog of vehicles and loss of market share to its main u.s. rivals, ford motor co. and chrysler corp
uncertainty over gm's prospects was heightened after the october stock market crash, which raised fears that consumers would buy fewer cars. all domestic automakers trimmed production plans afterward, but pessimism has since been eased by healthy sales
in january, ford motor co., the nation's no. 2 automaker, added 75,000 cars to its plans for the first half of 1987, including 53,000 cars in the second quarter, said ford spokesman raymond windecker
chrysler corp., the no. 3 automaker, announced plans last week to add 20,000 cars to its second-quarter schedule
chris cedergren, an industry analyst with the firm j.d. power and associates, said the change in gm's plans reflect ``a little bit of resurgence'' of sales
he noted that the added cars are high-profit models, an indication that gm's profitability may improve in 1988 after two years of higher earnings by ford
the changes do not affect gm's buick-oldsmobile-cadillac group assembly plant in kansas city, mo., still scheduled to shut down indefinitely on april 15, idling 1,600 workers, gm spokesman tom pyden said. condom</head>
a new ``condom for females,'' pioneered in europe, was hailed by developers as revolutionary, but an independent researcher questioned the device's effectiveness
the disposable contraceptive, made of polyurethane, resembles a condom but is worn by women, researchers said wednesday as they publicly unveiled the device
the developers said the female condom would be effective at preventing pregnancy and predicted it would become a major weapon in the fight against the spread of aids and other sexually transmitted diseases
it takes the advantages of both the male condom and the female diaphragm and gets rid of significant disadvantages,'' said mary ann leeper, head of the research team developing the device for wisconsin pharmacal co., which will market it in the united states and canada
but dr. gerald zatuchni, a gynecologist with 25 years experience in researching and developing new contraceptives, said he saw the potential for ``real problems'' with the device
i have not seen the device nor have there been any published studies that would indicate its acceptability to couples, the effectiveness of the device in preventing pregnancy or any side-effects from using the device,'' zatuchni said
the device, known in europe as a ``fem-shield'' or vaginal shield, isn't sold anywhere yet, but testing has begun in europe and is to start in the united states in march, officials said
the developers said they wouldn't have statistics on how effective the device is in preventing pregnancy or the spread of diseases like acquired immune deficiency syndrome until additional studies are completed
the contraceptive consists of a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane sheath and two diaphragm-like, flexible polyurethane rings, ms. leeper said
one ring lies inside the sheath and serves as an insertion mechanism and internal anchor, fitting against the woman's cervix much like a diaphragm, she said. the other ring forms the outer edge of the sheath and remains outside the vagina
it is no more difficult to insert than a tampon,'' said dr. paul salmon, who helped organize tests of the device at london's middlesex hospital
the company, based in jackson, wis., said the device would provide more protection than the male condom, in part because the material is stronger and covers a larger physical area, reducing chances of infection or exposure to body fluids
it also would be more convenient to use than a diaphragm, ms. leeper said, because it doesn't have to be initially fitted by a doctor and can be inserted ``six hours before the sex act or six minutes before.''
but zatuchni, a gynecology and obstetrics professor at northwestern university medical school in chicago, said the idea of a ``one-size-fits-all'' condom for females ``would be sort of ridiculous because women's anatomy varies so much.''
it would be hard to envision such a device staying on during the act of intercourse,'' zatuchni said
ms. leeper said proper fitting would take place during intercourse
she said the company had no estimate on how much the device would cost consumers
the ``female condom'' was developed by an international group of gynecologists and obstetricians, headed by danish gynecologist dr. erik gregersen and his wife, bente
the device has been tested on 80 couples in the united kingdom, denmark and sweden, and additional clinical trials are continuing in europe, ms. leeper said
the world health organization also plans to conduct clinical trials in 15 countries, including brazil, thailand, singapore and nations battling the spread of aids in central africa
aids, a deadly disease with no known cure, is believed to be spread mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants at or before birth
in the united states, a first round of 500 clinical tests of the new contraceptive is to begin in march, followed by a second phase of 1,000 tests in may, ms. leeper said
the company hopes to apply to the u.s. food and drug administration this summer for permission to begin marketing the device commercially in the united states by the end of the year
the lawyer for a south american mineral concern suing the hunt brothers of dallas opened his case wednesday by spinning a tale of financial intrigue involving texas oilmen and arab sheiks
minpeco s.a., a mineral marketing company owned by the peruvian government, is suing the three hunt brothers, claiming they conspired to corner the world silver market in 1979 and 1980
named as defendants in the case that opened before u.s. district judge morris e. lasker were: nelson bunker hunt, william herbert hunt and lamar hunt
we will show that they did this using their incredible fortunes with utter contempt for the legal and economic system that was so good to them,'' mark cymrot, attorney for minpeco, told the jury in his opening statement at federal court in manhattan
none of the hunts were present in court and they were not expected to appear until the defense begins its case
other defendants include mahmoud fustok, described as the owner of one of the world's largest thoroughbred stables and brother-in-law of a saudi arabian prince
we will show that they were greedy, power-hungry and unscrupulous,'' said cymrot, adding ``what we intend to show is that these men rigged the silver market.''
he claimed that the hunts and their alleged co-conspirators were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $9 an ounce to more than $50 an ounce between september 1979 and january 1980
minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused it to lose more than $100 million when the world silver market collapsed in march 1980, with prices falling back to about $10 an ounce
six financial institutions accused of participating in the alleged conspiracy have settled with minpeco for a total of $64.6 million
minpeco is seeking about $150 million in damages plus treble damages under both the anti-trust and racketeering laws which it claims the hunts and thier co-conspirators violated
but in his opening argument to the jury, the hunts's lawyer belittled those claims
the defense lawyer, paul curran, said rising interest rates, inflation and crude oil prices, coupled with an unstable world political situation, led to the silver market price rise
he ticked off the iranian revolution, the seizure of american hostages at the u.s. embassy in teheran and the soviet invasion of afghanistan
it was these world and economic events that were the reason for the sharp rise in silver prices,'' said curran
he conceded silver prices went up, but noted gold, platinum and diamond prices also rose during the same period because ``the price of silver has historically fluctuated as a result of events in the market place and in the world.''
the trial is expected to last several months
signs warning of potentially harmful chemicals in everything from foods to workplaces will sprout across california this weekend under a law approved by voters in 1986
warning: this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause cancer.'' this sign could be seen on store shelves
warning: chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be present in foods or beverages sold or served here.'' this sign could be printed on restaurant menus
warning: this area contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause cancer.'' this sign could be posted on a service station island, along a factory fence or on an assembly line
in addition, there will be labels, newsaper advertisements, letters and telephone hot lines telling people about chemicals in the products they buy and the environment in which they work and live
but there probably won't be any warning signs for the more than 15,000 grocery, drug and cosmetic products bought every day. temporary state regulations say that such products manufactured under existing state and federal rules don't have to contain warnings
the signs will be the first visible result of the anti-toxics initiative approved by voters following a bitter struggle between environmentalists who wrote the measure, including the sierra club and the environmental defense fund, and business interests
proposition 65 will also mean confusion, with businesses responding differently to its warning requirements. and dozens of lawsuits could occupy the courts for years as supporters and opponents continue to quarrel over its intent and requirements
the period ahead will be filled with charges and countercharges, pressures and counterpressures and intense courtroom litigation,'' says assemblyman tom hayden, one of the initiative's major backers and the leader of a star-studded hollywood group that campaigned hard for the measure
there are probably still people who wish the proposition had never happened ... but there are people who have come to grips with it as an expression of people's concern,'' said thomas warriner of the state health and welfare agency, who wrote the regulations
the initiative requires anyone who causes people to be exposed to any of 29 chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or birth defects to issue an advance warning
those chemicals include five that business officials say are present in varying levels throughout society: asbestos, benzene, lead, chromium and arsenic
for example, benzene is in gasoline and most service stations will probably have to post warning signs on their fuel islands. chromium is in stainless steel, magnetic tapes, paint pigments and cement
also, citizens who feel they've been exposed to a cancer- or birth defect-causing chemical can take action if authorities won't and collect 25 percent of any eventual fine
republican gov. george deukmejian, who opposed the initiative, followed issued the list of 29 chemicals ``known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity'' and has appointed a 12-member panel to study whether more than 200 other chemicals should be added to the list
backers of the plan sued deukmejian, saying the initiative required about 250 chemicals to be on the first list. a superior court judge agreed, but the deukmejian's appeal is pending
the advisory panel has in the past year added almost all the 200-plus chemicals to the list. but adding them later, rather than on feb. 27, means they are subject to the initiative's other requirements at later dates
the initiative requires any business with 10 or more employes to give a ``clear and reasonable warning'' before exposing anyone to any of the chemicals on the list, beginning one year after their making the list
another part of the initiative doesn't take effect until oct. 27 for the first 27 chemicals. that part prohibits businesses from discharging any of the listed chemicals into drinking water sources, beginning 20 months after a chemical's inclusion on the list
henley group inc., rebuffed in its latest attempt to take control of santa fe southern pacific corp., has accepted the rejection quietly
we are disappointed but not surprised,'' said henley spokesman norm ritter
santa fe southern on wednesday turned down henley's bid to buy 44.6 million new shares for $780 million. the offer, made on monday, was conditioned up the company abandoning its ``poison pill'' takeover defense and restructuring a $4.7 billion special dividend to stockholders
the chicago railroad, land and natural resources concern also rebuffed henley late last year when henley offered to buy the entire company for $63 a share, or $8.34 billion
santa fe's directors discussed the latest proposal with their investment bankers and legal advisers and concluded the plan would benefit only henley, santa fe president robert d. krebs said in a letter to michael dingman, henley's chairman
that ownership percentage would transfer effective control of the company without the payment of a control premium to our shareholders,'' krebs wrote. ``in addition, the offer would dilute the interests of all our shareholders except for the henley group.''
henley's proposal would have given it 34.3 percent ownership of santa fe. the la jolla, calif., manufacturing, engineering and financial-services firm currently holds a 15.7 percent stake
santa fe stock rose 75 cents to $24.25 share wednesday in new york stock exchange trading
krebs said in his letter to dingman that santa fe's special-dividend plan represented a better value to shareholders than the alternative proposed by henley
the rejected henley proposal asked santa fe to stop the planned march 1 payment of $5 per share in ``junk bonds'' for each of its 157.3 million shares. santa fe already has made a $25-per-share cash payout as part of the special dividend
henley contends the bonds will leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the way they are structured
instead, henley proposed that santa fe sell it $780 million worth of new stock at $17.50 per share. proceeds from that deal would have been used to make a one-time $5-a-share cash payout to all shareholders
henley had also asked santa fe to void the poison pill takeover defense it adopted in december
under the defense, if any stockholder's stake exceeds 20 percent, other santa fe shareholders would be permitted to buy new stock at half price, diluting the hostile buyer's stake and making a takeover prohibitively expensive
henley has said the takeover defense restricts the maneuverability of major holders like itself and toronto-based real estate concern olympia &amp; york developments ltd
olympia &amp; york, which is controlled by canada's reichmann family, has a 10.5 percent stake in santa fe. the company last week launched a $17.50 a share million tender offer worth $245 million to boost its holdings to 19.9 percent
olympia &amp; york had agreed to support santa fe's restructuring in return for two seats on the santa fe board
meanwhile, henley is waging a proxy fight in hopes of gaining control of santa fe's board of directors at the company's may 24 annual meeting, and is suing santa fe in delaware, where both companies are incorporated, to block the $4.7 billion special dividend
u.s. treasury secretary james baker said thursday he was satisfied with the current exchange rates between the dollar and the japanese yen, according to japanese officials in seoul
baker reportedly expressed that view when he met with japanese prime minister noboru takeshita in seoul thursday. both were attending the inauguration of south korean president roh tae-woo
efforts to stabilize the exchange rates have been successful,'' a japanese foreign ministry official quoted baker as telling takeshita
the official, haraguchi koichi, said baker predicted that the slumping u.s. economy would recover soon and grow at least 2.5 percent this year. fourth-quarter gnp.; uppicks 3rd graf pvs: exports rose...</note>
the u.s. economy surged ahead at its fastest pace in two years _ a robust 4.5 percent annual rate _ in the last quarter of 1987, the government said today
the commerce department's measure of growth in the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, amounted to an upward revision from a month ago, when the gnp was put at a slightly slower 4.2 percent growth rate
such a strong performance is usually considered good news, but some economists fear this time may be an exception
they note that three-fourths of the $42 billion in growth in the october-december quarter came from a $32.1 billion rise in business inventories, which came as consumer spending was falling at its fastest rate in more than seven years
that means production will have to be cut back sharply in coming months to work down the excess inventories _ meaning the overall economy will also probably slow as well in the first half of 1988
a separate report wednesday offered encouraging news on another front, however, when the commerce department said record exports helped shrink the nation's trade deficit at the end of 1987
exports rose 6 percent as the trade deficit narrowed to $40.2 billion on a balance-of-payments basis in the last three months of the year, the department said. it was the first quarterly improvement since the spring of 1986
we have a genuine export boom going on and i think a lot of people are pleasantly surprised,'' robert ortner, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, said in announcing the turnaround
in other economic news wednesday, sales of u.s.-made cars and light trucks jumped 14.5 percent in mid-february in a development that analysts attributed to plentiful, aggressive buyer incentives
the consumer has more confidence in the economy than the analysts do,'' said chris cedergren, industry analyst with j.d. power and associates in agoura hills, calif
the news had little impact on wall street, where the dow jones average of 30 industrials edged up 0.83 point to 2,039.95. the dow fell 1.17 on tuesday
gold prices tumbled on expectations of continued low inflation. republic national bank of new york quoted a bid price for gold of $432.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. est, down $8.70 from tuesday's late level
the dollar, meanwhile, turned in a narrowly mixed performance on the world's foreign-exchange markets. bond prices edged marginally lower as a major new issue of treasury bonds waited in the wings
ortner said further improvements in trade were likely in the months ahead because of the beneficial effects of the cheaper dollar, which has declined sharply in value since late 1985 as part of a reagan administration effort to thwart protectionist sentiment in congress
still, the year finished with a record $159.3 billion balance-of-payments trade deficit for all of 1987, the report said
in volume alone, the trade deficit actually showed a 5 percent improvement from 1986 to 1987. the fact that import prices rose more rapidly than export prices helped mask this improvement, commerce department analysts said
the new figures confirmed an end-of-year narrowing of the trade shortfall that already had shown up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. the earlier figures showed a $43 billion deficit for the fourth quarter and a $171.2 billion shortfall for all of 1987
wednesday's figures were smaller because they subtracted factors such as the cost of shipping, insurance and military sales from the monthly numbers. the balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not. wires.</note>
the u.s. economy grew at a robust 4.5 percent annual rate in the final three months of 1987, the fastest pace in almost two years, the government said today
the commerce department's estimate of growth in the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, represented an upward revision from a month ago, when the gnp was put at a slightly slower 4.2 percent growth rate
president reagan, boasting about the country's longest peacetime recovery on record, had given a small preview of today's good news during his wednesday night news conference. reagan, who is briefed on the economic figures in advance, said they would contain ``a little good news.''
economic expansion at such a rapid clip would normally bring cheers, but the lopsided nature of this increase is instead raising concern among private economists that the recovery will weaken considerably in the first half of 1988
analysts base this forecast on the fact that three-fourths of the $42 billion in growth in the october-december quarter came from a $32.1 billion rise in business inventories, which came as consumer spending was falling at its fastest rate in more than seven years
this ominous combination means that production will have to be cut back sharply in coming months to work down the excess inventories
a buildup of inventories and weak consumer spending can trigger a recession, but most economists believe that the country will be able to escape a downturn this year although they are forecasting very weak growth during the first six months
the rapid rate of growth in the fourth quarter was accompanied by little pickup in inflation. a price index tied to the gnp was rising at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to a 3.4 percent increase in the third quarter
the 4.5 percent increase in economic growth followed a gain of 4.3 percent in the third quarter and was the fastest advance since a 5.4 percent rise in the first quarter of 1986
the fourth-quarter gain boosted growth for the year to 3.9 percent, when measured from the end of 1986, up slightly from the 3.8 percent estimate made a month ago
the reagan administration is forecasting that growth this year will slow to a rate of 2.4 percent. many private economists believe even this scaled-down figure is too optimistic
those analysts think that growth in the current january-march quarter will slow to a barely discernible 1 percent rate _ or even less. they expect a gradual strengthening for the rest of the year as growth in export sales offsets a slowdown in consumer spending
the administration is expecting the country will get half of its growth this year from an improving trade deficit as american manufacturers continue to benefit from the decline in the value of the dollar
the upward revision in gnp growth in the october-december quarter came despite the fact that the shrinking in the trade deficit was not as large as originally thought
the various changes added $42 billion to the total gnp, leaving it at $3.877 trillion after adjusting for inflation
in addition to the big rise in business inventories, other sources of strength included a 13.4 percent increase in government spending and an 8.1 percent increase in housing construction
the trade deficit, after removing the effects of inflation, improved as exports shot up by 15.1 percent, outpacing a 9.7 percent rise in imports
the 3.1 percent drop in consumer spending was the biggest setback since a 5.4 percent drop in the first quarter of 1980, a slowdown that occurred during the brief recession that year and which has been cited as a contributing factor to jimmy carter's defeat
the reagan administration, wanting to keep the white house in republican hands, hopes that the big plunge in consumer spending this time does not signal another recession
david wyss, an economist with data resources inc. of lexington, mass., said he expected the gnp would rise at a sluggish pace of 1.4 percent this year as consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, slows appreciably
wyss said economic growth in the current january-march quarter is likely to slow to around 1 percent with the second quarter possibly posting a negative number
however, he said the country will probably avoid a recession, which is defined as at least two quarters of negative gnp growth, because continued strength in american exports will offset the weakness in consumer spending
michael evans, an economist for a washington forecasting firm, said he has changed from predicting a recession and now believes the country has a 50-50 change of avoiding a downturn
he said a key bit of evidence will come with next week's release of unemployment figures for february
if we had a big gain in employment in february, then the chances of the consumer leading us into a recession are much weaker than i thought,'' he said
japan's inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose 1.9 percent in december from a year ago, the government reported thursday
meanwhile, the government said the nation's major retailers saw sales climb by 7.1 percent in january over the same month last year on the strength of clothing purchases
the statistics bureau of the prime minister's office said december's 1.9 percent consumer spending gain compared with an adjusted 2 percent rise in november
bureau officials said the december increases came largely in the areas of education, utilities, clothing and entertainment
shareholders of broken hill proprietary co. on thursday approved a major restructuring of australia's largest company, which included the repurchase of most bhp shares owned by its two biggest stockholders
under the plan outlined late last month, broken hill will pay 2.1 billion australian dollars, about $1.5 billion at current exchange rates, to buy back 300 million bhp shares controlled by financier robert holmes a court, a persistent suitor for the company
the buyback will reduce holmes a court's stake, held by his bell resources conglomerate, to 10 percent from 29 percent
broken hill also plans to pay 575 million australian dollars to elders ixl ltd., a diversified company run by entrepreneur john elliott, for a 50 percent interest in an elders unit that owns 19 percent of bhp, reducing elliott's broken hill stake by half
elliott and holmes a court also will resign from broken hill's board of directors
the steel, oil and mining company, which has major holdings in the united states, south america and elsewhere has been eager to reduce the influence of both entrepreneurs, especially because of holmes a court's repeated attempts in recent years to buy control of the giant company
elders had acquired its stake in broken hill in 1986 to thwart a takeover attempt by holmes a court
broken hill also had been concerned that holmes a court and elliott might dump their shares following october's stock market crash, depressing the company's stock price
companies controlled by holmes a court lost about 500 million australian dollars in the stock market crash, the biggest corporate loss in australian history, due to investment writedowns. the financier has been selling a number of assets to help ease cash problems raised by the sharp decline in its market value during the crash
broken hill is selling at least 1 billion australian dollars worth of non-strategic investments and assets to help finance its restructuring, which was expected to cost 2.68 billion australian dollars, about $1.9 billion
sir james balderstone, chairman of broken hill, said the restructuring would not be completed for several months
balderstone said the plan would be completed once the transactions with holmes a court and elliott were settled, broken hill shareholders approved the plan to cancel the 300 million shares acquired from holmes a court and australia's supreme court approved the reduction in broken hill's capital
broken hill's plans received clearance tuesday by australian securities regulators, who said they would not take any action because shareholders of all companies involved were to vote on the proposals. incentives; subs 14th graf to remove first reference to phillippi; picks up 15th graf pvs bg'ng, sales of ...</note>
sales of domestic cars and light trucks in mid-february slowed from early in the month but jumped 14.5 percent over the same period a year earlier, reflecting aggressive buyer incentives offered by automakers
general motors corp., ford motor co. and chrysler corp. wednesday reported healthy sales increases over a year earlier, which were not shared by most foreign makers who build cars in this country
they had a lot of help from incentives. i think that's pretty evident looking at chrysler's numbers. chrysler has had huge incentives,'' said joseph phillippi, an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. in new york
total domestic car sales rose 11.9 percent in the nine selling days from feb. 11-20, while domestic truck sales, which increased for all makers, jumped 19.6 percent as the surge in light-truck popularity showed no sign of slowing
the eight companies building domestic vehicles sold 325,422 cars and light trucks in mid-february, up from 284,278 a year earlier _ 210,316 cars and 115,106 trucks, compared with 188,001 cars and 96,277 trucks a year earlier
but mid-february domestic car sales moved at a seasonally adjusted rate of less than 7.8 million a year, down from an 8.4 million rate in early february
the consumer has more confidence in the economy than the analysts do,'' said chris cedergren, industry analyst with j.d. power and associates in agoura hills, calif
all economic indicators point to lower sales for 1988 than 1987,'' cedergren said. ``we do expect the downward trend to continue.''
nevertheless, the big three have shown renewed optimism toward the u.s. economy and vehicle market, increasing planned production for 1988 in reverses of cuts planned after the stock market crash in october
gm announced wednesday it is restoring second shifts at three plants, reopening a framingham, mass., assembly plant on one shift and boosting overtime at other car and truck plants
the increases will put 8,600 laid-off workers back on the job and will add 175,000 cars and trucks to gm's 1988 production schedule
in mid-february, chrysler led the big three in domestic car sales increases with a 21.7 percent boost. chrysler's domestic truck sales rose even further, jumping 47.3 percent over mid-february 1986
gm reported a 16.3 percent increase in domestic car sales and a 21.8 percent boost in domestic truck sales over mid-february a year earlier. ford's car sales rose 2.2 percent and truck sales increased 5.4 percent
ford's share of the domestic car market fell to 28.8 percent from 31.5 percent a year earlier, while gm's share jumped to 50.7 percent from 48.8 percent a year earlier and chrysler's share grew to 15.5 percent from 14.3 percent a year earlier
gains by gm and chrysler were somewhat deceptive because both had weaker sales in mid-february 1986 than ford, and both have needed to use incentives more aggressively than ford this year, phillippi said
sales of u.s.-built cars fell 4.5 percent for honda motor co., 23.9 percent for volkswagen and 10.7 percent for nissan motor corp
toyota motor corp. sales of domestic cars rose 72.2 percent, continuing a buildup from 1987. toyota, like mazda motor corp., has only been building cars in the united states for a short time
mazda began u.s. production in the fall at its flat rock assembly plant
oil prices tumbled substantially today, reflecting growing market nervousness that world supplies are increasing too fast
at midday, contracts for april delivery of west texas intermediate, the benchmark u.s. crude, stood at $16.03 per 42-gallon barrel, down 43 cents from wednesday's close on the new york mercantile exchange
among march contracts for refined products, wholesale heating oil was selling at 45.45 cents a gallon, down 0.95 cent from wednesday, while unleaded gasoline stood at 45.45 cents per gallon, 0.90 cent lower
peter beutel, assistant director of the energy group at elders futures inc., said fundamental and technical factors were pushing the prices lower, with crude touching as little as $15.98 a barrel at one point before struggling back
opec is producing about 1 million barrels a day more than it was a month ago, and this perception is getting into the market _ which isn't thrilled by it,'' he said
recent estimates have put production by members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries close to 18 million barrels a day
beutel said the slide also picked up after crude broke below $16.37 a barrel, ``which had been seen as a very important support level.''
grain and soybean futures prices opened lower across the board today on the chicago board of trade
new rains in the major soybean-growing region of brazil prompted selling of u.s. soybean futures, analysts said. traders are watching the south american soybean crop closely as harvest time rapidly approaches
the thinking is that inevitably (u.s. soybean) prices will go down as these crops come in, unless we get some major improvement in demand, which is not likely,'' said walter spilka, an analyst for smith barney, harris upham &amp; co. in new york
corn futures failed to follow through on wednesday's gains, which were spurred by rumors of soviet purchases of u.s. corn
the agriculture department announced after the close of trading wednesday that the soviets had purchased 350,000 metric tons of u.s. corn, an amount that spilka said was ``not enough to carry the markets very far.''
wheat futures slipped lower on a lack of fresh supportive news, he said
in early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1\ cents lower with the contract for delivery in march at $3.16} a bushel; corn was { cent to 1{ cents lower with march at $1.98 a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents lower with march at $1.89{ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 4 cents ower with march at $6.22\ a bushel

a former top editor of one of the world's most powerful newspapers has taken up a new challenge: to send people packing
harold evans, who resigned as editor of the times of london in 1982 in a dispute with owner rupert murdoch over editorial independence, has changed his itinerary to become editor in chief of a new travel magazine, conde nast's traveler
traveler, launched last fall by conde nast publications inc., a division of privately-owned newhouse newspapers, already prides itself in being different from the scores of other magazines aimed at the booming travel industry
it is hard-hitting _ in the tradition of fleet street, not madison avenue _ with pointed writing, vivid photographs, fold-out maps and offbeat humor
evans planned the magazine for conde nast starting in september 1986 _ following stints as editorial director of u.s. news &amp; world report and editor in chief of atlantic monthly press, a publishing company
the 59-year-old ``harry'' evans has put his personal stamp on traveler, which has a full-time staff of around 40 and claims a monthly circulation of some 900,000 copies. for starters, unlike traditional travel magazines, traveler doesn't allow its writers to accept free trips or accommodations
we pay our own way; the plan is to be truthful,'' evans said in an interview in his office on madison avenue. ``we print things without fear.''
that policy has generated, for example, an investigative article on airline safety and a report that 22 of 56 cruise liners failed recent inspections by the u.s. public health service
such ``truth in travel'' has already had repercussions. last november, after traveler printed a summary of a report by the world health organization on air pollution in more than 50 cities around the world, ads for varig brazilian airlines were pulled from the magazine
the advertising agency for varig, jonas berger associates, told traveler it cancelled the ads for brazil's national airline because it couldn't ``understand the logic in your telling your readers about the pollution problem in rio de janeiro.''
evans, in turn, fired off an unrepentant editorial. ``readers are tired of fluff and puff,'' he wrote. ``they know it's a big world where sometimes it's sunny and sometimes it rains. they want to be stimulated, but they want to explore and enjoy with all the facts and insights they can acquire.''
the editor's pull-no-punches approach has led traveler to take other strong editorial stands _ advocating, for instance, efforts to preserve wildlife in africa and natural beauty spots in the united states
the magazine's brash approach may have been emboldened by the built-in circulation it inherited from its predecessor, signature magazine. conde nast, a titan of magazine publishing, bought signature in january 1987 from citicorp diner's club for around $40 million _ then relaunched it as traveler last september
although traveler is a completely new product, it picked up a circulation of around 700,000 copies a month from the defunct signature
in its first four issues (from september through december of last year), traveler carried 198.5 advertising pages, bringing in around $4.2 million in ad revenues, according to figures compiled by the publishers information bureau
ronald galotti, traveler's publisher, said the magazine is aiming for more than 500 ad pages this year, which would translate into $12 million to $13 million in revenues. ``we're running very, very much on target,'' he said
travel &amp; leisure, a magazine owned by american express co. that is the dominant force in the travel field, carried around 1,227 pages last year fetching $38.5 million
evans seems to relish bridging the gap between his hard-knocks newspaper upbringing and the upscale world of magazines. at work, he is a whirling dervish of energy _ talking rapid-fire, punctuating his remarks by jumping up to pull out documents and magazines to illustrate his points, fretting over a technical production problem. he seems to have brought the high-tension level of a big-city newspaper to the normally more subdued environs of magazine publishing
a native of manchester in england's industrial north, he started in 1954 as a reporter for the manchester evening news and later became editor of the northern echo, a regional daily
evans is no stranger to this country. besides his more recent jobs with u.s. news and atlantic monthly, he spent 15 months here in 1984 on a journalism fellowship, advising and working on several small-town newspapers. he also was an adviser to gannett co. inc., which publishes usa today
he has encouraged offbeat humor in traveler _ like a guide to shoe-shopping in paris titled ``confessions of a shoe fetishist'' and a regular feature called ``room with a view'' profiling specific hotel rooms. october's was room 472 in the hotel splendido in portofino, italy, where elizabeth taylor and richard burton stayed in 1976
the magazine's style, with a breezy sophistication bordering on snobbishness, has prompted some critics in publishing circles to deride traveler as ``vanity fair goes to the beach.'' the editor in chief of vanity fair, another conde nast magazine that touts good writing, is tina brown _ who is married to evans. moved in advance.</note>
traveler, a new monthly magazine launched by conde nast publications inc., joins a crowded field of publications aiming to tap the booming u.s. market for travel and americans' growing fascination with jet-set lifestyles
americans spent a commanding $255 billion on domestic travel and another $24.5 billion on trips abroad in 1986, according to the u.s. travel data center in washington, d.c
the dominant magazine in the field, travel &amp; leisure (owned by american express co.), is being challenged by a legion of new or reincarnated rivals for advertising dollars
in the past two years, according to adweek magazine, the new york times has acquired and revamped southern travel, reader's digest has purchased travel@holiday, publishing tycoon rupert murdoch has taken over european travel &amp; life, and cbs inc.'s sale of its magazine division has put adventure travel in the hands of an investor group
other contenders include frequent flyer, connoisseur and national geographic. banana republic, a retail clothing chain owned by the gap inc., plans a safari into the field next month with a ``hip'' new quarterly called trips
foreign bankers are putting the finishing touches on secret bids for bonds offered by mexico in an innovative scheme to get rid of some of its enormous foreign debt of $105 billion
the question for mexico is how many of its approximately 560 creditor banks will submit bids under the program before the deadline at 4 p.m. est friday
the plan was devised by the mexican and u.s. governments to try to reduce mexico's heavy debt burden, the second highest in the developing world after brazil
christine bindert, senior vice president at the investment firm of shearson lehman brothers inc. in new york, said the program ``should be fairly successful with a lot of participation, particularly from european and (u.s.) regional banks.''
the big money center banks in the united states, though, were expected to shun the program
they're bound to get some takers,'' said a european banker in mexico city, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``the question is: how many, and at what price?''
the new program involves exchanging some of the debt mexico owes foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds that will be issued by the government
the bonds, which will be backed by $10 billion worth of special u.s. treasury securities, will carry a higher interest rate than mexico is paying on the old debt
analysts doubt the government will be able to market the entire $10 billion package. mexican officials, they say, would like to sell at least $3 billion of the securities
the success of the program hinges on the sticky question of how much the banks are willing to take for their old loans. in early february, mexican debt was selling for about 48 cents on the dollar in the secondary market
in the auction, the bankers will try to get as much money as they can for their old loans, while mexico will want to buy the debt cheaply
analysts predict the average discount rate will range from 60 cents to 70 cents on the dollar
some banks have expressed concern about the program because they are unhappy that mexico will still get loans at 100 percent of their value while paying back, through the new program, its old loans at less than that
they also are reluctant to accept losses on the loans and worry about government regulations concerning accounting for the losses on their books
mexico's treasury secretary, gustavo petricioli, recently asked u.s. officials to give ``the most favorable treatment possible'' to banks taking part
the program will let mexico retire part of its foreign debt for less than face value and slice the $8 billion or so annual interest fee on the debt
the banks are submitting sealed bids to j.p. morgan &amp; co., the new york banking company acting as exchange agent for the deal. morgan said earlier this week that it had already received some offers, but it declined to release any details
mexico is expected to announce next week how many _ if any _ bonds will be issued. officials have said that if the offers are not good enough, they may reject all of them
as the deadline neared this week, many bankers were reluctant to say if they would bid
we're still studying the program in terms of our own participation,'' said james h. mitchell, spokesman for bank of america in san francisco
in london, none of britain's big four commercial banks would say whether they planned to bid
we haven't said what we're going to do,'' said an official at lloyds bank. added an official at national westminster bank, ``our decision hasn't been made yet.'' both demanded anonymity
analysts expect smaller banks, worried about holding mexican debt, to use the program as a way to get out of international lending
the chairman of britain's midland bank, sir kit mcmahon, found the plan inappropriate for banks wanting to remain in the business because it involves explicitly accepting that the debt is worth less than its face value, a spokesman said
that echoed comments by john reed, chairman of citicorp, the biggest bank-holding company in the united states. ``we're long-term lenders, and we're happy with our portfolio,'' he said
the bonds being offered are good ideas for banks who want to get out of lending to latin america and provide a good way for those institutions to lower their exposure to third world countries,'' reed told the new york times
however, west germany's largest bank, the deutsche bank, said it would bid for the bonds
there had been so many proposals to solve this problem,'' said spokesman hans dettmar. ``finally this plan comes up. it's a new approach, and we want to see how it works.''
japanese banks also were close-mouthed about their plans
in tokyo, an official of a major bank said no decision had yet been made. ``but i think that even if we do participate, it will not be in a very aggressive manner,'' he said, demanding anonymity

a conrail engineer convicted of manslaughter after a train crash that killed 16 people said today drug and alcohol abuse are a major problem in the railroad industry and random testing of rail workers is needed
i believe that random drug and alcohol testing is the appropriate response to an industry-wide problem,'' the engineer, ricky l. gates, said in testimony to the senate commerce committee
gates has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the jan. 4, 1987, crash in which the conrail locomotive he was driving slammed into a crowded amtrak train near chase, md. sixteen people were killed and 175 were hurt in the crash
gates has admitted he smoked marijuana shortly before the accident. the national transportation safety board has said that marijuana use by gates and his brakeman, edward w. cromwell, was the primary cause of the accident
while the act of using the marijuana contributed to his inattentiveness, there is no proof that mr. gates was impaired,'' one of gates' lawyers, donna shearer, said in testimony for the senate committee
i cannot begin to imagine the pain and grief i have caused those touched by the accident,'' said the statement by gates, who faces sentencing march 29. ``i am sorry.''
gates said railroad management ``often looks the other way'' when a worker has a drug or alcohol problem. ``i know this because once when i was called to work ... i told the dispatcher that i was intoxicated and could not work,'' he said. ``i was told if i did not report i would be cited for refusing duty.''
i believe that drug and alcohol use is widespread in the industry,'' gates said
conrail spokesman pat linsky said the railroad was studying gates' remarks, and would have no immediate comment
the senate last year approved legislation that would require various types of drug and alcohol testing of rail, airline, trucking and bus company employees. but the house has yet to act on similar legislation
the most controversial type of testing proposed is random testing of transportation workers. supporters say random testing is the only true deterrent to drug and alcohol abuse, while opponents say such testing is an invasion of privacy and is often inaccurate
earlier this month, a federal court in san francisco ruled that testing rail workers involved in accidents based on a suspicion that they had recently used drugs or alcohol is illegal
sen. ernest hollings, d-s.c., chairman of the senate panel, expressed frustration that the house has so far not approved a bill requiring drug and alcohol testing of transportation workers

share prices closed sharply higher thursday as trading volume picked up to its best level in several weeks
dealers said moderately bullish company earnings reports spurred good buying interest by financial institutions. price rises accelerated further in the afternoon in response to impressive gains in early wall street trading
the momentum is very strong,'' a dealer said
at the close, the financial times-stock exchange 100-share index was up 22.3 points, or 1.27 percent, at 1782.4, its best level for the day. the index opened in positive territory and rose steadily throughout the day, picking up steam after new york began trading
share prices were boosted by good earnings reports from royal insurance plc, imperial chemical industries plc and british telecom plc. the results helped allay fears that companies' profitability might have suffered significantly as a result of the october stock crash, dealers said
cable operators that own part of turner broadcasting system inc. have tentatively agreed to accept $35 million in stock instead of a cash dividend payment, tbs chairman ted turner said
this will give us some breathing room,'' turner told reporters tuesday after addressing a business group. ``we are drawing up the documents now, but we think we've got it nailed down.''
a group of about 30 cable operators invested $560 million in turner broadcasting last year and is due to receive the dividend in april. the operators also were given seven seats on the 15-member tbs board of directors
under the original agreement, tbs had to pay the dividend within six months of april 15 or give the cable operators two more seats on the board. one cable operator said the original investment was drawn up under the impression that turner broadcasting's $1.4 billion in debt would be refinanced by this time
much of the debt stems from turner's purchase of the metro-goldwyn-mayer film library, which has become a staple of programming on the tbs cable channel. the debt carries a 16.5 percent interest rate
turner has said his company was close to a refinancing agreement early last fall, but the stock market plunge in october made it impossible to work out a favorable deal
under what turner called an ``agreement in principle,'' turner broadcasting would pay the dividend with shares of its class b stock, which closed tuesday at $8 per share on the american stock exchange. at that price, turner's equity ownership in tbs would fall to about 49.7 percent from the current 51 percent
the class b stock was created so that tbs could use it for business transactions such as paying the dividend without causing turner to lose voting control of the company
the deal would cause virtually no dilution of turner's 68 percent voting stake in the company. poorly</head> family size; picks up 2nd graf pvs bg'ng, the mixed ...; subs 6th graf to delete reference to adjustment; picks up 7th graf pvs bg'ng, among the ...; also moving on general newswires</note>
median family income rose 20 percent from 1970 to 1986 when adjusted for inflation and family size, but the gains were uneven and families with children fared worse than other groups such as the elderly, according to a congressional study released thursday
the mixed news came from the non-partisan congressional budget office in an analysis that contradicts a widespread impression, based on other studies, that family income has stopped growing
sen. pete domenici, r-n.m., one of those who sought the cbo report, said it suggests positive general trends in family income. but rep. george miller, d-calif., who made a separate request for the analysis, said it contained plenty of bad news as well
even among those families for whom incomes rose, cbo found that the principal reason among the non-elderly was the increased number of workers per family. in many families, both parents must now work to maintain the standard of living,'' said miller, who released the report at a hearing of the house select committee on children, youth and families, which he chairs
miller also cited cbo findings that young families, low-income families with children and poor single-parent families in 1986 were much poorer than their counterparts in 1970
nearly half the overall 20 percent increase in family income occurred between 1970 and 1973, according to an analysis of the cbo data by miller's committee staff. the staff also said virtually all the remaining growth occurred since 1982
among the cbo findings:
_median adjusted family income for families headed by people over 65 grew by more than 50 percent over the 16-year-period. but for married couples with children it grew only 26 percent; for single mothers with children, it rose 2 percent; and for families headed by people under 25, it dropped nearly 20 percent _ with the entire decline coming since 1979
_median adjusted family income rose between 12 percent and 37 percent for all families with at least one full-time, year-round worker. for families with children and no such worker, it fell 10 percent
_median adjusted family income fell 13 percent for low-income single mothers with children, with one-fifth of such families having less than half the income needed to live at the poverty level in 1986
cbo said the elderly as a group were most protected from the tides of the economy, while the fortunes of others rose and fell with recessions and upswings throughout the period
much of the rapid growth of income among the elderly was due to higher social security payments, the office said. income growth in other groups was spurred by a rise in two-worker families, which ``offset the fact that earnings did not keep pace with inflation for some workers,'' cbo said
domenici, ranking republican on the senate budget committee and a member of the new national economic commission, called the trends among single-parent families ``disturbing but not surprising.'' he said any deficit reduction plans would be carefully examined for their impact on households headed by young or single parents
however, domenici said the trends for some vulnerable family groups would have been less negative if cbo had included non-cash benefit programs such as food stamps, and the 1986 tax law which took many low-income families off the tax rolls
cbo said its assessment differs from earlier, more pessimistic ones because it made adjustments for smaller family size and used a more accurate inflation index. without those adjustments, the office said, the trend would have been a 4 percent drop in family income rather than a 20 percent boost
the office said lack of family-level data precluded adjustments for non-cash programs, which have improved the situation of low-income families, and tax hikes before 1981, which shrank disposable income. cbo said it was impossible to project the net effect of either omission
indications that the brazilian soybean crop may be larger than expected sent u.s. soybean futures prices down modestly thursday on the chicago board of trade. grain futures closed mixed to lower
soybean futures opened lower on news that rain had eased dry conditions in the soybean-growing region of brazil. later in the morning, the brazilian institute of geography and statistics estimated the impending harvest would yield 19.4 million metric tons, significantly higher than the u.s. agriculture department's latest estimate of 18.5 million metric tons
this estimate was obviously negative for the u.s. market, and it took off any rallying attempt the beans might have had,'' said walter spilka, an analyst in new york for smith barney, harris upham &amp; co
grain and soybean futures also retreated in reaction to generally lower prices for other commodities, spilka said

assets of the nation's 418 money market mutual funds climbed $2.56 billion in the latest week to a record high level of nearly $280 billion, the investment company institute said thursday

usg corp. kept quiet thursday about two texas oilmen's $1.96 billion takeover attempt of the nation's largest producer of gypsum, an important building material
at this time, we have nothing to say on any aspect of this,'' said paul colitti, a spokesman for chicago-based usg
desert partners l.p., controlled by oilmen cyril wagner jr. and jack e. brown, said wednesday it would pay $42 a share in cash for at least 21.5 million common shares, or less than half the total shares outstanding
the rest of the shares would be exchanged for subordinated debt securities and warrants valued by desert partners at $42 a share
analysts didn't give the proposal much chance of success because of usg's previously stated desire to avoid dealing with wagner and brown, takeover strategists who have made forays against several companies
some suggested the partners might be seeking a way to increase the value of their 9.9 percent stake in the company, purchased last fall at between $44 and $45 a share, so they could sell it with minimal loss
investor reaction to the bid was skeptical. usg's stock, which rose $4.62{ wednesday to $37 in composite new york stock exchange trading, fell back to $35.87{ thursday
in a letter to robert j. day, usg chairman and chief executive officer, desert partners said it is genuinely interested in acquiring the company and will refuse to accept ``greenmail'' _ the purchase of its usg stock at a premium over the market price _ from usg
the company produces gypsum and gypsum-related products in about 100 plants nationwide. gypsum is a mineral component of plaster and other building materials
we're hopeful, now that we've made a specific proposal, that usg's board, recognizing its fiduciary responsibilities, will give it serious consideration,'' said joel reed, president of a desert partners subsidiary formed to try to acquire usg
in november, usg senior management said it had no interest in participating in a buyout of the company with desert partners
the latest proposal came after a federal judge in chicago on monday blocked usg's request to permanently bar desert partners from buying additional usg shares
last week, mesa limited partners, headed by corporate raider t. boone pickens, disclosed its 1.5 percent stake in usg
several years ago, wagner and brown teamed with pickens in a number of takeover attempts, but desert partners has denied that the parties have joined to gain control of usg this time
in its letter, desert partners said it has invested about $225 million, or about $44.30 a share, to accumulate its stake in usg. the partnership owns about 5.08 million common shares. update on analysts' estimate</note>
eastman kodak co., under fire for purportedly overpaying in its $5.1 billion acquisition of sterling drug inc., said thursday it expects to earn profits ``well in excess'' of the amount predicted by wall street analysts
the effort to whip up enthusiasm fell short. kodak was the most actively traded issue on the new york stock exchange thursday but managed to rise only 62{ cents a share to $42. the stock had traded at $49.12{ just before the sterling deal was announced
analysts had lowered their 1988 earnings projections for kodak by about 35 cents a share since jan. 1, prompted mainly by kodak's announcement last month of the agreement to buy sterling, the new york-based maker of bayer aspirin, lysol cleaner and prescription drugs
based on what we have learned from sterling and what we know about kodak, we believe that reduction can be put back into analysts' estimates,'' kodak president kay r. whitmore said in a prepared statement
we're very optimistic about the future,'' the president added in an interview
kodak did not speak out on sterling until this week because its tender offer for sterling shares was still pending. the offer expired monday and kodak is mopping up the final details of the acquisition
analysts who follow rochester, n.y.-based kodak had continued to cut their earnings estimates as recently as wednesday
on thursday, analyst eugene glazer of dean witter reynolds inc. said kodak seemed to be trying to convince analysts that the company would earn $4 a share or more in profit in 1987. he said he was likely to raise his own estimate of $3.85 a share
last year operating earnings were about $6.31 a share, although various special charges reduced net earnings to $3.52 a share
the heavy load of debt kodak took on to finance the sterling purchase helped convince both standard &amp; poor's corp. and moody's investors service to lower their credit ratings on the company to the lowest levels in its modern history
kodak has run into other troubles recently:
_polaroid corp. disclosed that it is seeking $5.7 billion in damages for kodak's infringement on its instant photography patents
_a federal judge issued a temporary injunction blocking kodak's merger of its photofinishing operations with the colorcraft corp. photofinishing operations of fuqua industries inc
_kodak admitted that its innovative 9-volt lithium batteries, which were supposed to have a shelf life of 10 years, don't last that long
whitmore said the purchase of sterling was consistent with kodak's strategy for chemical sciences, would give the company a ``highly profitable revenue stream'' and offers opportunities for cutting costs by eliminating overlaps
so _ recognizing what we're receiving _ the price we paid is competitive, fair and indicative of sterling's inherent value to us,'' whitmore said in his prepared remarks
we now expect that the earnings we report for 1988 will meet or exceed (wall) street's pre-merger consensus, even after taking into account the dilutive effect of the sterling merger,'' whitmore said
britoil plc on thursday dropped resistance to british petroleum co. plc's $4.4 billion takeover offer for the north sea oil company even though britoil still believes the price is inadequate
britoil's board of directors said it was advising shareholders to accept the offer of $8.80 a share for britoil's 504 million shares outstanding
the britoil board had vigorously opposed the company's takeover by bp, which controls 81 percent of britoil's stock
the government announced on tuesday that it wouldn't use its special share in britoil to block the offer, as long as bp kept promises to meet certain conditions
among them were that bp would maintain the headquarters for some of britoil's operations in glasgow, scotland
the government had retained the special share _ which gives it the veto power over the company's affairs _ when it privatized britoil in two stages in 1985 and 1982
britoil chairman sir philip shelbourne said in a letter to shareholders: ``your board continues to believe that 500 pence ($8.80) represents an inadequate price for an ordinary share in britoil, but there are now considerable uncertainties confronting shareholders who might wish to remain a minority in britoil.''
he said the continued listing of the company's shares could not be guaranteed and that the market value of the shares would likely fall after the bp offer closes
the offer currently is open indefinitely
britoil's shares finished unchanged at 498 pence or $8.76 on the london stock exchange thursday
the nation's basic money supply fell $1.1 billion in mid february, while two broader measures, m2 and m3, rose by $6.3 billion and $11.7 billion respectively, the federal reserve board reported thursday
the fed said m1 fell to a seasonally adjusted $759.9 billion in the week ended feb. 17 from $761 billion the previous week. m1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks
for the latest 13 weeks, m1 averaged $755.4 billion, a 2.1 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks
since early 1987, the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 growth because of ``uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to a variety of economic and financial circumstances and assumptions.''
m2, made up of m1 and such accounts as savings deposits and money-market mutual funds, rose to a seasonally adjusted average of $2,945.7 billion in the week ended feb. 17. this compared with a revised $2,939.4 billion the previous week, which was originally reported as $2,939.9, the fed said
for the latest 13 weeks, it averaged $2,915.8 billion, growing at a 4.1 percent rate of gain
m3, the sum of m2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000, rose to a seasonally adjusted average of $3,722.7 billion in the same period
this compared with a revised $3,711 billion in the previous week, which originally reported as $3,712 billion, the fed said
for the latest 13 weeks, m3 has averaged $3,680 billion, growing at a 5.1 percent rate of gain from the week earlier, the fed said
the fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for ms and m3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent
analysts warned that it is difficult to draw short-term conclusions about the meaning of the three figures, because they are inclined to be volatile on a week-to-week basis
beth reiners, an analyst at the dean witter reynolds securities firm, said the data were mainly in line with the company's expectations, and had no impact on the bond market

the dollar rose in europe on expectations that the u.s. government would revise its estimate of growth in the gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1987 to 5 percent from 4.2 percent
but the report, released in the middle of the european trading day, put the latest estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth at 4.5 percent
as a result, the dollar turned lower, finishing the day in new york at lower levels than it traded at late wednesday
dan holland, a vice president at discount corp. in new york, said some traders bought dollars before the trade report was released because they interpreted president reagan's comments on the economy at a news conference wednesday night as indicating growth had been stronger than expected
but, he said, once the report was released and the revision was only modest, some dollar traders sold the u.s. currency
jack barbanel, senior vice president at gruntal &amp; co., said the dollar took its cues from the bond market where a rally faltered at midday

the federal communications commission on thursday signaled to foreign governments that the united states remains concerned about markets that have been closed or severely limited to u.s. telecommunications manufacturers
the fcc stopped short of taking action that would reciprocally exclude or limit foreign-owned companies from participating in the u.s. market, though chairman dennis r. patrick said such measures ``are still very much open, very much alive'' at the commission
the fcc said it needs more information on the trade imbalance and ordered large long-distance and local phone companies to report annually to the agency on big equipment purchases, including switches and transmission equipment
by seeking this information we in no way imply an opposition to foreign participation in u.s. markets,'' said fcc chairman dennis r. patrick. ``we believe in the economic utility of free trade and in the proposition that, through that free trade, consumers in the united states benefit by access to goods and services that are provided by concerns around the world
however, we also believe in the principle of reciprocity and there ought to be equally open markets in other parts of the world,'' he said
the u.s. telecommunications equipment trade deficit is about $2 billion annually, the fcc said
japan, germany and france are among the countries whose telecommunications trade policies have contributed heavily to the deficit
the fcc will require annual reports from the country's seven largest long-distance companies as well as the local bell and large independent companies. it also will require interstate carriers that are 15 percent or more owned by foreign interests to file annual revenue and traffic reports
the reporting requirements were proposed in december 1986 by then-chairman mark s. fowler. at the time, the commission also sought comments on steps the fcc could take in pressuring foreign countries to open their markets
fowler, now in private law practice in washington, said there is no need at this time to change u.s. trade policy in reaction to closed foreign markets, but ``by leaving the question open, there's the spectre of further government action.''
his intention in initiating the proposal was to put foreign governments on notice of the u.s. concerns, he said
the only way we could get some countries' attention was to hit them over the head with a threat,'' he said, adding, ``there's more utility in making the threat than in implenting it.''
northwest airlines and flight attendants bargained intensively thursday to avert a weekend strike, but a union representing the workers said a walkout appeared likely
there's a 100 percent chance of a strike,'' said william genoese, director of the international brotherhood of teamsters airline division. ``as far as i'm concerned we're on a collision course with northwest airlines to strike.''
flight attendants were preparing to strike at midnight friday if an agreement wasn't reached
airline spokesman redmond tyler said progress is being made on some major contract issues. the two sides have been meeting since tuesday at northwest's world headquarters with the assistance of a federal mediator, tyler said
senority wage scales, pensions and work rules are among the major issues in the dispute. former republic airlines flight attendants have been working under their old contract since northwest acquired republic in 1986. the company is trying to bring the workers under one contract
we believe we're making substantial progress at the bargaining table,'' tyler said. ``we're not jimmy the greek, but we continue to believe that we will get this resolved without a strike.''
the national president of the international association of machinists has vowed his union's support of the flight attendants, but stopped short of saying machinists would honor picket lines. officials at national and local iam offices did not return telephone calls for clarification
tyler said machinists are under a contract that forbids them to strike in sympathy with another union. ``we expect our machinists to honor their contract,'' he said
pilots are forbidden from sympathy strikes under provisions of the railway labor act, tyler said
asked if those workers would be lockd out if they walk off their jobs in sympathy with the flight attendants, tyler said, ``we won't address that because we don't want to play that `what if?' game.''
genoese said flight attendants would have the full backing of the international teamsters, which could result in delays of supply shipments from truckers
industry analysts were skeptical of the teamsters power to disrupt northwest. anthony hatch, an airline industry analyst for argus research of new york, said genoese is ``overblowing the role the teamsters play in an airline.''
it's pilots and machinists that shut down an airline and nothing else,'' hatch said
tyler said the airline is armed with about 2,000 management workers who are certified as flight attendants to step if the 6,700 union flight attendants strike
domestic automakers were scheduled to produce 211,513 cars and trucks this week, down from last week's 219,021, ward's automotive reports said thursday
automakers produced 252,785 cars and trucks during the same week a year ago. they were were scheduled to make 126,984 cars this week, compared with 133,536 a week ago and 174,075 in the same week in 1987
truck production for the week was scheduled at 84,529, compared with last week's 85,485 and last year's 78,710

the teamsters union considers employee-led buyouts of airlines and other companies as part of its ``global strategy,'' but has no concrete buyout proposals, the president of the teamsters airline division said thursday
william genoese, responding to questions at a news conference, said the union was studying the possibility of leveraged buyouts or friendly takeovers of pan american world airways, northwest airlines and usair
but he characterized any employee-led buyouts as mere possibilities under the teamsters' long-term strategy rather than as certainties
also, two investment bankers mentioned by genoese said they were not working on any airline takeover proposals with the teamsters
genoese said discussion of union-led buyouts was not a ploy, but he conceded that ``the threat of it will help you in negotiations.''
negotiations between pan am and the teamsters, which represents 4,500 pan am ground employees in 14 cities, over $35 million in concessions broke down on sunday
although the union had set a strike deadline for that night, its members have continued reporting to work. genoese has said a strike remains possible and has threatened to disrupt pan am ground operations
pan am has said it needed a total of about $540 million in concessions from all its unionized employees during the next three years to ensure its survival
northwest is negotiating with its flight attendants on a new contract an faces a midnight est friday strike deadline. genoese spoke at a news conference about the likelihood of a strike by northwest attendants, who also are represented by the teamsters
genoese said he had spoken recently with experts at the investment firms of salomon brothers inc. and drexel burnham lambert inc. about how to finance airline buyouts
drexel was an adviser to the coalition of four pan am unions that unsuccessfully attempted to find a buyer for the financially troubled airline last year, but says it has not dealt exclusively with the teamsters in that regard
robert salomon, a managing director of salomon brothers, said he was unaware of any contact between the teamsters and salomon regarding airline buyouts
genoese also said he had spoken monday with jay pritzker, chairman of braniff inc., about a possible joint bid for pan am. braniff in january dropped a proposal to acquire major elements of pan am corp., the airline's parent, after the pan am pilots union decided to oppose the plan, which called for $800 million in wage concessions over four years from the company's unions
pritzker, through a spokeswoman at his chicago office, declined to comment
genoese said that by considering employee-led buyouts the union simply was examining the same financing techniques used by wall street takeover artists
you can do the financial end as well as (takeover strategist) carl icahn and be good to the people,'' genoese said. ``you're going to see some of these moves pretty soon in the papers.''
coffee futures prices fell sharply thursday, reversing a five-month trend on speculation that a tight supply situation may soon ease, analysts said
on other markets, energy futures prices dropped; grains and soybeans moved lower; precious metals gained slightly; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; and stock-index futures retreated
coffee contracts on new york's coffee, sugar &amp; cocoa exchange lost as much as 2.87 cents a pound as the executive committee of the international coffee organzation opened a two-day meeting in london
at that meeting, delegates from consumer nations complained of slow shipments of high-quality beans from producer nations and claimed some producer nations had sold coffee at discounted prices to non-member nations, said sandra kaul, an analyst in new york for shearson lehman hutton inc
the apparent willingess of some producers to sell coffee at a discount, along with news that colombia had begun registering coffee for export in april, suggests an easing of supplies, ms. kaul said
this indicates that the short-term supply situation that pushed the market up so sharply is about to come to an end at the same time that seasonal demand eases,'' she said
in addition, analyst kim badenhop of prudential-bache securities noted that coffee prices were nearing levels that could trigger a relaxation of ico export quotas and increase shipments
coffee settled 2 cents to 2.87 cents lower with the contract for delivery in march at $1.3829 a pound
crude oil futures slipped below $16 a barrel while gasoline and heating oil prices fell sharply on the new york mercantile exchange
a department of energy report issued wednesday showing an 8.5-million-barrel increase in u.s. oil stocks triggered the sell-off, said bob baker, an analyst for prudential-bache securities inc
but peter beutel of elders futures inc. linked the price decline to perceptions of rising oil production by opec members
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 40 cents to 50 cents lower with february at $15.36 a barrel; heating oil was 1.18 cents to 1.25 cents lower with march at 45.22 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .98 cent to 1.10 cents lower with march at 45.37 cents a gallon
indications that the brazilian soybean crop may be larger than expected sent u.s. soybean futures prices down sharply on the chicago board of trade. most grain futures declined slightly
soybean futures opened lower on news that rain had eased dry conditions in the soybean-growing region of brazil. later in the morning, the brazilian institute of geography and statistics estimated the impending harvest would yield 19.4 million metric tons, significantly higher than the u.s. agriculture department's latest estimate of 18.5 million metric tons
this estimate was obviously negative for the u.s. market, and it took off any rallying attempt the beans might have had,'' said walter spilka, an analyst in new york for smith barney, harris upham &amp; co
wheat settled 1} cents lower to } cent higher with march at $3.17} a bushel; corn was \ cent to } cent lower with march at $1.98{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with march at $1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 3} cents to 8 cents lower with march at $6.21 a bushel
gold and silver futures posted modest gains on new york's commodity exchange after two days of steep losses
the precious metals are caught in tug-of-war between bulls who believe inflation is set to rise and bears who feel a recession is near, said jack barbanel, an analyst for gruntal &amp; co
it's a very volatile marketplace,'' he said
gold settled 60 cents to $1.30 higher with april at $434.70 a troy ounce; silver was 4.9 cents to 5.2 cents higher with march at $6.245 a troy ounce
most livestock and meat futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange
the cattle market was choppy but ended higher on improved demand from packers, while pork prices rose on expectations for stronger cash markets next week, said philip stanley, an analyst in chicago for thomson mckinnon securities inc
live cattle settled .20 cent to .40 cent higher with april at 72.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .25 cent higher with march at 80.67 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .25 cent higher with april at 44.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to .60 cent higher with march at 52.57 cents a pound
stock-index futures retreated on the chicago mercantile exchange, where the contract for march delivery of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index settled 2.35 points lower at 262.85. the underlying spot index was down 2.86 points at 261.58
hundreds of angry, sign-waving workers protesting the possible sale of chrysler corp.'s parts-making division gathered outside company headquarters thursday shouting ``strike! strike!.'' ``you do whatever you need to do _ and you know what to do,'' united auto workers union vice president marc stepp told more than 1,000 workers who marched in windy, 20-degree weather for more than two hours
chrysler chairman lee iacocca has said chrysler is considering selling its 28,000-worker, $1 billion acustar inc. parts-making subsidiary and may announce a decision next month
the union is trying to pressure chrysler into retreating from the sale, which stepp said threatens the job security of all chrysler workers and is further damaging chrysler's already injured labor relations
besides potential strikes over local issues at key plants that could shut chrysler down, local leaders said they will stop cooperating in programs aimed at improving quality and efficiency
chrysler spokesman doug nicoll said chrysler had no immediate comment
acustar, which has plants in mexico and canada as well as the united states, represents nearly a fifth of chrysler's worldwide operations, already the leanest among the big three u.s. automakers
chrysler has said it may sell acustar because it doesn't want to invest in the research needed to upgrade some operations. chrysler already buys 70 percent of its parts elsewhere
before the demonstration, stepp met in detroit with the 140-member chrysler national bargaining council, which represents all of chrysler's 49 uaw locals, and about 100 others who came to listen
the union cannot legally call a national strike over the sale of acustar. but stepp said he told the council he will authorize locals to strike on a plant-by-plant basis over unresolved issues such as health and safety grievances
at least seven chrysler locals already have voted to ask for authorization and one, at chrysler's key 4,000-worker stamping plant in sterling heights, will receive permission as early as next week, stepp said
other locals are gathering grievances and preparing to take strike votes and seek national authorization. if disputes aren't resolved, local unions may strike seven days after they receive authorization
the council unanimously passed a resolution calling for suspension of all joint labor-management programs, including special team-concept agreements at six plants, that require trust and cooperation
workers say they are angry at the possible sale because they made concessions and helped iacocca win loan guarantees from the federal government to rescue the company from the verge of bankruptcy eight years ago
let this be a lesson to all america, to trade unionists everywhere, if you think you can work out some cooperative programs to generate trust with this corporation, forget it, because you can't,'' stepp told the protesters. correct that coniston is a partnership, update with final stock price. picks up 8th graf pvs: analysts believe ...</note>
gillette co. urged its stockholders thursday to resist an attempt by coniston partners to seize four seats on gillette's board of directors
coniston wants gillette to boost the value of its stock, by selling itself to another company, or selling off its assets piecemeal or restructuring its finances. gillette chairman colman m. mockler jr. asked stockholders not to sign proxy cards being distributed by coniston, which controls a roughly 6 percent stake in the consumer products maker
the board of directors believes the stated intentions and suggestions of this group are not in the best interests of your company and intends to oppose the group's actions vigorously,'' a letter from mockler to stockholders said
coniston, a new york investment partnership, announced earlier this month that it was approaching potential buyers of the boston-based company and might take other moves to boost gillette's share price
the firm last week nominated four candidates for the seats on the 12-member board of directors up for election at gillette's annual meeting april 21. stockholders as of march 7 will be eligible to take part in the board vote
this letter is essentially a stop, look and listen letter,'' gillette spokesman dick gauthier said
gillette stock fell $1.37{ a share to $39.87{ thursday in consolidated new york stock exchange trading
analysts believe gillette's recent stock price is well below the high-$40 to low-$50 range estimated as its acquisition value. the company late last year rejected a $47-a-share, $5.4 billion buyout offer from revlon group inc., which has bid for gillette since 1986
the company reported a 12 percent rise in sales and doubling in operating profits last year
gus oliver, a general partner in coniston, said thursday the company stood by its position that the proxy fight was necessary because gillette's takeover defenses meant the board had power to accept or reject any merger offers
he criticized mockler's letter but said: ``i think it's to be expected from this particular management and board of directors.''
the letter said gillette would ``act vigorously'' to resist attempts by coniston to gain a greater stake in the independent company, known for its personal products such as razor blades and pens
the board regrets that a costly proxy contest for the control of the direction of your company may develop, particularly at the time when the company is starting to realize many of the ongoing benefits of its restructuring activity,'' the letter said
coniston sucessfully waged a similar strategy of ``strategic block investing'' last year that led to the break-up of allegis corp
your board of directors believes that this is but a catch phrase for trying to force the sale or dismemberment of companies in which coniston takes positions,'' mockler said
from what little is publicly known about coniston partners, neither it nor its partners have any direct experience in managing or running an international consumer products firm.''
gillette reported net income of $229.9 million on sales of $3.17 billion for 1987 compared with net income of $15.8 million on sales of $2.82 billion in 1986. the 1986 figures included a special charge of $165.3 million
excluding the charge, gillette reported earnings per share of $2 last year compared with $1.42 in 1986
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned the reagan administration that further attempts to pressure the central bank to lower interest rates could boomerang
greenspan's warning came wednesday as the administration sought to dampen its dispute with the fed. beryl sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said the administration is ``delighted with monetary policy.''
at issue is a critical letter sent by assistant treasury secretary michael darby to top fed policy-makers 10 days before they were to meet to set 1988 monetary growth targets
the nation's record trade deficit shrank in the final quarter of 1987 as u.s. exports climbed 6 percent to record levels, the commerce department says
while narrowing just $200 million from the summer, the deficit's decline to $40.2 billion on a balance-of-payments basis marked the first quarterly improvement since the spring of 1986, the department said wednesday
robert ortner, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, said further improvements were likely
sales of domestically made cars and light trucks jumped 14.5 percent in mid-february from a year earlier despite cold weather that could have kept some buyers out of showrooms, automakers said
total domestic car sales rose 11.9 percent in the nine selling days from feb. 11-20, while domestic truck sales jumped 19.6 percent, the automakers reported wednesday
general motors corp., ford motor co. and chrysler corp. reported healthy increases in sales, which were not shared by most foreign-based automakers
general motors corp. has boosted 1988 production plans by 175,000 cars and trucks and will recall 8,600 laid-off workers and reopen a temporarily closed assembly plant
the strengthening demand for gm vehicles reflects the ongoing product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and employee involvement programs,'' gm president robert stempel stated wednesday
gm will increase production by running some plants, particularly for trucks, on overtime; restoring second shifts at two u.s. plants and one in canada; and reopening its closed framingham, mass., assembly plant
santa fe southern pacific corp. has rejected henley group inc.'s latest offer to buy a controlling interest in the company
santa fe said wednesday that the proposal would give henley an effective controlling stake in the company without having to pay a premium to other shareholders
henley, which holds a 15.7 percent stake in santa fe, offered monday to buy 44.6 million new shares for $780 million if the chicago company would abandon its ``poison pill'' takeover defense and restructure a $4.7 billion special dividend to stockholders
dart group corp. says it will continue a $1.03 billion hostile takeover bid for stop &amp; shop cos. inc., which is negotiating with several other potential buyers
stop &amp; shop confirmed wednesday it had begun talks with several parties considering a buyout of the supermarket and discount store chain, raising the possibility it might find a ``white knight'' friendly suitor to thwart dart
sandy bouzoukis, a stop &amp; shop spokeswoman, declined to name the parties interested
the federal communications commission on thursday voted to extend through 1989 american telephone &amp; telegraph co.'s 12.2 percent authorized rate of return on its regulated interstate operations
the fcc also decided to extend the 12 percent rate of return that local telephone companies can earn on the payments they receive from long-distance companies for providing access to the local networks
the fcc had set those rates in august 1986 to cover the calendar years 1987 and 1988. the commission voted 3-0 to extend the rates for a third year because economic conditions are about the same today as they were when the rates were set two years ago
fcc chairman dennis r. patrick said the extension would also add stability to phone rates and give the commission more time to refine the formula for determining appropriate rates of return
gerald brock, the fcc's top telephone staff official, said the action has ``no direct effect'' on the commission's proposal to replace rate-of-return regulation of at&amp;t and the local bell phone companies with a cap on the rates they can charge
the agency proposed a broad rate-cap plan last august and, under pressure from congress, said recently it will propose a more specific plan, probably this spring
under the current form of regulation, the fcc sets the profit level it will allow for phone companies under its jurisdiction and allows that target to be met over a period of time
a federal appeals court earlier this year struck down the fcc's rules for ordering refunds by companies that exceed their authorized rate of return because the rules didn't permit companies that earn less than the allowed rate to recoup any shortfalls
the court invited the agency to fashion a new refund policy, but the fcc has not yet responded
