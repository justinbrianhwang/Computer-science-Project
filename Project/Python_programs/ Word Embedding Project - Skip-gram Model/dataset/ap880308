a nearly monolithic black vote and almost 10 percent of the white vote gave jesse jackson a super super tuesday, while sen. albert gore jr.'s tennessee roots helped him in the south, exit polls said
enormous support for the reagan administration fueled george bush's sweep, powering the vice president to victory among virtually all segments of the republican party, the polls said
gov. michael dukakis of massachusetts was helped in florida by older voters. lagging among the democrats was rep. richard gephardt, apparently damaged by attacks from dukakis and gore suggesting he had flipped-flopped on important issues, the surveys indicated
while jackson did better among white voters than he did in his 1984 race for the democratic nomination, ``this is a hell of a polarized election in terms of race,'' said sheldon gawiser, an nbc news poll analyst. ``he's still not making major inroads into that vote, with the exception of massachusetts and virginia.''
jackson polled more than nine in 10 southern black voters, polls said. among white voters, abc news exit polls said jackson had about 9 percent in the south, while the cbs news-new york times poll said he had 8 percent. nbc figures ranged from 4 percent in tennessee to 15 percent in virginia and 19 percent in massachusetts
surveys of republican voters as they left the polls found overwhelming approval of president reagan, and those voters went strongly for bush, who had stressed his links to the administration
it's coattails, there's no doubt about it,'' said gawiser. ``reagan is extremely popular in the south and bush is certainly riding those coatails.''
in georgia and florida, for example, the cbs news-new york times poll found approval of reagan at the 80 percent level, and bush won two-thirds of those voters, said pama mitchell, cbs manager of surveys
he's carrying conservatives. he's carrying moderates. this is almost boring: it's all bush,'' mitchell said
the support for the vice president was as longstanding as it was widely spread. sixty percent of the republican voters in georgia, for instance, had made up their minds even before last month's new hampshire primary, and most of them went for bush, mitchell said
however, she said, bush also won among the republicans who decided more recently whom to support. and in florida, she noted, he even won four in 10 of the minority of voters who did not approve of reagan
among the democratic candidates, jackson as expected enjoyed massive support from black voters, but also won support from about 9 percent of the white voters across the south, abc news exit polls said
blacks made up 25 percent of the democratic vote, and more than nine in 10 of them went for jackson, abc and cbs reported. among white voters across the south, about a third each supported dukakis and gore, and 15 percent backed gephardt, abc reported
gephardt is not doing well; his negatives are high,'' said mitchell, of cbs. ``it looks like maybe this stuff has been sticking where they say he's been flip-flopping.''
she also noted that trade issues, a keystone of gephardt's campaign, was considered important by few southern voters
gore, meanwhile, won support from the 27 percent of democrats who called themselves conservative, with the backing of 35 percent of that group, abc said. dukakis won 23 percent of conservatives, jackson 19 percent
abc said gore also led among the democratic voters, a third of the total, who voted for reagan in 1984. thirty-five percent went for gore, 25 percent for dukakis and 15 percent for gephardt
jackson and dukakis split the moderates, with 26 percent each, and jackson won 43 percent of the liberal vote, to 28 percent for dukakis, abc said
in florida, with its large population of retirees, 47 percent of the democratic voters were 60 and over, cbs reported, and 52 percent of them backed dukakis
the cbs-times poll indicated that some of gore's support vis-a-vis dukakis stemmed from the tennessee senator's southern roots. fifty-two percent of democratic voters in the south said they were born there, and 31 percent of them backed gore to 20 percent for dukakis. thirty percent were for jackson
gore and dukakis split the white vote in the south, 35 percent for gore and 33 percent for dukakis, mitchell said. the two men also split those democratic voters, 30 percent of the total, who decided since saturday
the cbs-times results for the south as a region had a margin of sampling error of about 2 percentage points, mitchell said. the results based on state samples varied, but mostly were about 5 percent
a squirrel that somehow scampered into the oklahoma museum of natural history broke two pieces of pottery dating to the year 1200 and chipped a vase, a museum spokeswoman said
workers searched unsuccessfully monday for the bushy-tailed marauder and tried to block entry points for animals
we've taped up, we've nailed up,'' said collections manager julie droke. ``we're hoping that he left.''
the two pots, found in oklahoma and had an estimated value of $200 to $500, were broken sunday, she said
a 2{ foot vase, found in leflore county and reconstructed, also was knocked over and chipped, she said

massachusetts gov. michael dukakis won delegate-rich texas on tuesday, sweeping the top three delegate states in democratic presidential primaries, while vice president george bush coasted to victory in the republican race
in the democratic race, with 3,506 of 6,933 precincts or 51 percent reporting, dukakis had 233,204 votes or 32 percent; tennessee sen. albert gore jr. had 166,692 votes or 23 percent; jesse jackson had 139,612 votes or 19 percent; missouri rep. richard gephardt had 118,127 votes or 16 percent; former colorado sen. gary hart had 39,444 votes or 5 percent; and illinois sen. paul simon had 13,533 votes, or 2 percent
with 2,013 of 5,616 precincts or 36 percent reporting, bush had 184,472 votes or 63 percent; pat robertson had 46,629 votes or 16 percent; kansas sen. bob dole had 40,808 votes or 14 percent; and new york rep. jack kemp had 14,366 votes or 5 percent
texas offered the highest number of democratic delegates on super tuesday, with 183. dukakis also carried florida, which has 136 democratic delegates, and massachusetts, which has 98 delegates
also on the ballot, three-term sen. lloyd bentsen won renomination against democratic primary opponent joe sullivan, a san antonio college professor. republicans seeking to challenge bentsen were rep. beau boulter of amarillo, former state rep. milton fox of austin, georgetown industrialist ned snead and houston businessman wes gilbreath
bush, who rents a motel in houston so he can vote in texas, pushed hard for the biggest prize of super tuesday: texas' 111 convention delegates
texas is the jewel in the crown of the 20-state super tuesday,'' former u.s. sen. ralph yarborough said in reference to the state offering more delegates than any other in tuesday's primaries
voter registration was up by more than 500,000 and secretary of state jack rains predicted the total vote could go as high as 2.5 million
bush, who built an oil business in texas, led in polls throughout the campaign
as a texan, i know our state's special needs,'' bush said in a letter to potential gop primary voters. ``for 20 years in public life and for 20 years in business in midland and houston, i've prepared for this campaign and the challenge of serving as president.''
bush has staked a claim as ``native son'' in other states. he was born in massachusetts, reared in connecticut, and maintains a home in maine as well as in washington
dole insisted he was giving nothing away although his campaign appearances were limited and he skipped a major dallas debate
since texans don't register by political party, robertson said he was counting on substantial crossover support. ``that's my secret weapon. i've got tremendous appeal among democrats, and george bush doesn't,'' he said
also up for election this year are five seats on the texas supreme court, a bench wracked by negative national publicity over large campaign contributions to judges by lawyers, the public reprimands of two sitting justices and the failure of the nine-member court to even hear the appeal of an $11 billion judgment awarded in the texaco-pennzoil lawsuit. he''; insert new grafs 9-10 with robertson bgng ``pat robertson''; insert final graf gephardt comment bgng ``we had''</note>
there was nothing super in super tuesday for gary hart in the democratic race or for jack kemp in the republican. there were no cheering throngs, no victory parties
hart, whose battle cry was ``let the people decide'' when he re-entered the race last december, made no public comment after he failed to get into double-digit percentages anywhere. he had said last week that ``so long as i can be treated seriously, i will continue.''
hart listened to the returns on television at his home outside of denver
kemp too dwelled in the low single digits, choosing to be with his family in suburban washington rather than with supporters
bad as their vote totals were, they didn't approach those of others who had stopped campaigning but whose names remained on the ballot as ghosts of debates past
sen. paul simon passed up the super tuesday competition to rally the democratic troops in his homestate of illinois
in a sense, what happens after tonight is we start the campaign over in phase ii. and what i want to do is come out of illinois with a strong solid vote,'' simon said early in the evening
later he said the super tuesday results ``confirm that the democratic nomination process is in a state of confusion and gridlock'' and that ``the race is anything but over; it's just beginning.''
republican pat robertson also had a poor night. though he vowed to stay in the race until the national convention in new orleans, he said, ``if this isn't the one we'll be back four years later.''
rep. richard gephardt did well on the democratic ballot only in his home state of missouri
i'm far from chucking it in because this is a long race,'' said gephardt on cbs. ``we're going to go on to illinois, south carolina and michigan and try to get our message across and i think i can.''
gephardt, who has gone into debt, said ``we lacked sufficient resources to be able to get our message everywhere on super tuesday. that's not going to happen in the states that are coming up now.''
he complained about negative campaigning by michael dukakis and albert gore, who with jesse jackson, split the democratic vote
we had a situation where we had about $6 million or $7 million spent against us by those two candidates, against about $1 million we were able to spend,'' he said later in an interview with cnn. largest since delvalle removed; picks up 3rd graf pvs, ``small groups ...; subs 9th graf, ``the united ... with 1 graf to conform.</note>
riot police used truncheons and tear gas tuesday to disperse demonstrators who threw up barricades in hundreds of blocks in the capital to protest the strongman leadership of gen. manuel antonio noriega
reporters saw police beat demonstrators with fists and rubber truncheons and carry off at least eight protesters in military vehicles. a newspaper photographer, jose melendez of the mexico city newspaper excelsior, was slightly injured by birdshot fired by police
the demonstrations were easily the largest since president eric arturo delvalle was deposed feb. 26 after trying to fire noriega
the national civic crusade, an opposition coalition of political parties and civic and other groups, said at least 23 people had been detained during tuesday's protests. by late tuesday, the crusade said, only two of those were still unaccounted for. the others were released
small groups of demonstrators, most of them young, built barricades of garbage, tires, street signs and palm fronds in central and eastern parts of the capital
scores of barriers were set afire and plumes of black smoke rose over the city. most protesters ran when approached by riot troops, who jumped from trucks circulating through the capital and fired tear gas
many shopkeepers closed early
the clang of pots and pans _ a familiar symbol now of anti-government protest _ rang out from some apartment buildings
earlier tuesday, foreign minister jorge abadia charged that u.s. military maneuvers along the panama canal were ``a prelude to an armed invasion.''
abadia told a news conference that exercises begun over the weekend by the u.s. southern command were ``acts of arrogance that are intolerable'' and that panama was ``suffering the aggression of a foreign colossus.''
the united states has been calling for noriega's removal since his indictment in florida last month on drug trafficking charges. u.s. criticism of noriega increased after he orchestrated delvalle's removal
but a spokeswoman for the southern command, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied any hostile intent in the 5-week-long maneuvers, saying they were regularly scheduled annual exercises. they involve about 680 soldiers from u.s. military installations in panama and u.s. national guard members
abadia said panama ``cannot interpret ... (the maneuvers) as anything but the prelude to an armed invasion of panama and if we are mistaken, let them demonstrate that we're mistaken.''
dennis mcauliffe, administrator of the panama canal commission, meanwhile reported that the canal is operating normally, though u.s.-panamanian tension has caused strain on canal workers
no slowdown, no work stoppage, no troubles, no problems pertaining to payment,'' he said
the government set up dozens of mobile banks and special cashing posts tuesday for retired people, who took to the streets monday when they could not cash pension checks
banks have been closed since last week because of a cash shortage and fears of a run by depositors
in miami, a u.s. district judge froze panamanian assets in banks there after a suit was filed tuesday to prevent noreiga's government from withdrawing funds. a similar order was issued last week in new york city, and a suit was filed tuesday in boston
the miami suit was set in motion by panama's u.s. ambassador, juan b. sosa, who has refused to recognize the noriega government
delvalle, who remains in hiding in panama, is still recognized as president by the united states
abadia said tuesday the u.s. military maneuvers amounted to a violation of the 1977 panama canal treaties signed by the united states and panama
noriega, head of the 15,000-person defense forces, says washington intends to go back on its commitments. he has denied the drug trafficking charges
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters tuesday the reagan administration was still considering possible economic and trade sanctions against noriega's government
in a statement issued at both the white house and state department, the administration welcomed statements monday by delvalle and the opposition parties calling for establishment of a ``government of national reconciliation.''

the government has decided to standardize the spelling of a common name in malaysia
current variations on the name include mohamed, mohamad, mohamat, muhamat and muhammad
to simplify matters for the bureaucracy, the national registration department recently issued an order standardizing the spelling to muhammad
this does not mean that prime minister mahathir mohamad and information minister mohamed rahmat will have to change the spelling of their names
a spokesman for the department said tuesday the directive only applies to names recorded on birth certificates after the order was issued
china has 20 million surplus workers, although there are substantial manpower shortages in jobs requiring heavy labor, the official china daily said today
the newspaper said surplus workers in the work force of 132 million are costing the state billions of dollars and are a heavy burden to enterprises
it quoted the director of a boiler factory as saying his operation would be more efficient if the current staff of 10,000 was reduced by 4,000
but it said workers in overstaffed plants and unemployed youths are reluctant to volunteer for jobs in repair businesses or those requiring heavy labor. such jobs are filled mainly by surplus agricultural workers, it said. families</head>
an attorney for five relatives of challenger astronauts says that other families who settled with the government and with rocket maker morton thiokol for $7.7 million were shortchanged
that settlement is woefully inadequate,'' said ronald d. krist, a houston attorney who represented astronauts' survivors from the apollo spacecraft fire in 1967 as well as three families from the 1986 space shuttle disaster
krist said the four challenger families in the government-company settlement should have and ``would have netted more money'' if they had hired lawyers
the cost of the four-family settlement, which came in cash and annuities, was disclosed in government documents released monday
the documents show that morton thiokol, which produced the faulty booster rocket blamed for the jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the space shuttle challenger, paid $4,641,000, or 60 percent. the government's share of the settlements was $3,094,000, or 40 percent
the documents were released by the justice department to settle a civil suit brought under the freedom of information act by the associated press and six other news organizations
in court papers, the government acknowledged that the four settling families did not hire lawyers, relying instead on informal advice from leo b. lind, jr., executor of the estate of christa mcauliffe, a 37-year-old concord, n.h., public high school teacher killed in the explosion. lind is the law partner of mcauliffe's husband, steven
michael d. oldak, an attorney and ex-husband of mission specialist judith a. resnik, represented her father, marvin, in settlement talks with the justice department
i think it was a big mistake'' for the four settling families not to hire lawyers, oldak said monday. ``i think if i hadn't been involved, they probably may have coerced the resniks into accepting their original offer. these are people in the midst of their grief.''
oldak said the original government-company offer was ``a few hundred thousand,'' and ``i told them nicely what they could do with it.'' he rebuffed them again when ``nearly a year later, they doubled the offer.''
instead, marvin resnik settled with morton thiokol last month for an amount he put at between $2 million and $3.5 million. the government refused to contribute to the settlement
the government's treatment of the four families was viewed differently by betty grissom, whose husband gus died in the apollo fire
mrs. grissom said she received only $350,000, and had to sue north american rockwell on her own for that
i never heard from the justice department,'' she said. ``i thought we got an injustice done to us. they act like they care now, but they didn't back then
it kinda hurts,'' she added. ``it stings that ... we never got treated like that. it hurts when i think that they're getting that much money.''
the settlements were reached dec. 29, 1986, with the immediate survivors of spacecraft commander dick scobee, 46, a retired air force officer employed by the national aeronautics and space administration; mission specialist ellison s. onizuka, 39, an air force lieutenant colonel; payload specialist gregory jarvis, 41, an employee of hughes aircraft co.; and mcauliffe
the surviving four spouses and six children will receive more than $7,735,000, because each was given an annuity, which pays benefits larger than its cost but over a period of many years
the total dollar amounts they will receive over time and the breakdown by family were not released
among the disclosures:
_the justice department did all the negotiating for morton thiokol as well as the government. the families never spoke to company officials
_the rocket maker tried to have the settlements cover any property damage morton thiokol might have caused, such as destruction of the orbiter and payload, but the government refused
_although the justice department claims it cannot legally be sued by the families of military or federal civilian employees who die on duty, it contributed 40 percent to each of the settlements. only the jarvis and mcauliffe relatives had a right to sue the government directly; all the astronaut families could sue the company
morton thiokol attorney john w. adler said the government was being unfair to the parents of resnik, a 36-year-old civilian nasa employee, because of ``the government's refusal to participate to any degree at all'' in a settlement the company considered acceptable
resnik's mother, sarah resnik belfer, and jarvis' father, bruce, settled with morton, thiokol but the government did not contribute. so did cheryl mcnair, wife of mission specialist ronald e. mcnair, 35, a civilian nasa employee who had two infant children. all five were represented by krist
jane smith, wife of pilot michael j. smith, 40, a navy commander, has a suit pending in federal court against the company. the government last month got itself dismissed as a defendant, because military personnel may not sue the government for wrongful death
justice spokeswoman amy brown said the government made settlement offers to attorneys for the resniks, smiths and mcnairs based on the same formula used for the other families, but they were rejected. she said the government would not offer them settlements which exceeded the guidelines used for the other families or which were separate from settlements with morton thiokol. base</head>
leonore sarabia, clutching her sweater against the morning chill, awaited jesse jackson's arrival at the mirasol housing project, a heavily hispanic neighborhood where the presidential hopeful was searching out votes for today's election
she had come ``to check him out,'' she said, even though she already knew she would vote for him. she didn't really know anything about the other five democratic contenders, but jackson ``is more for the people,'' she explained as the candidate emerged from a limousine
two days earlier, it was tom trantham's dairy farm in the south carolina county where jackson grew up. there, he talked farm policy and shared a breakfast of grits and eggs with trantham and a few neighbors as cameras and reporters jostled around the table
the white farmers said they were grateful for jackson's support during the 1986 drought, when he helped unload trucked-in hay. but they were noncommittal about whether they would vote for him
i haven't made a decision,'' said bertha tinsley. her husband doug tinsley, fetching coffee refills for the jackson group, said he was a republican and would probably vote gop
the two campaign stops illustrate the challenge and the success jackson has had as he tries to expand his base beyond his core of black supporters
in the south, voters today are deciding if he can overcome what he describes as an ``ancient cultural barrier,'' and pull white support here as he did in five northern states with fractional black populations
today's super tuesday election, with 14 southern states among the 20 where voters are going to the polls, has shaped up as the day when jackson's presidential bid will shine
it is virtually certain he will be picking up more non-black votes than he did in his 1984 race. and he hopes to do well enough to lay to rest the so-called electability question, the notion that he can't be elected because he is black
casual interviews along the campaign trail indicate jackson has engendered considerable respect among southern whites. although some say the racial issue is not as much a factor as it was in 1984, they acknowledge it still remains for many
the older group, they won't change,'' jackson supporter thomas delong, a 57-year-old white student at mississippi state college, said of mississippi voters. he and others interviewed, said that among students, a group the campaign is targeting, jackson has considerable support
jackson's campus rallies are a big draw, and the enthusiastic audiences are sprinkled with whites, including republicans, who seem to come as much out of curiosity as anything
at the university of arkansas, white economics student tony green was impressed by jackson's powerful delivery, commenting, ``wow, quite a speech.''
he said race is not an issue for him but jackson ``is just too liberal.'' he may even vote republican if vice president george bush wins the gop nomination, he said
jackson has touted the endorsements of a handful of prominent white southern politicians including texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower, oklahoma state sen. gene stipe, and tennessean john j. hooker, a former gubernatorial candidate with close ties to former sen. albert gore sr., the father of one of jackson's rivals
in texas, with its large hispanic population, he was joined on the campaign trail by new mexico gov. toney anaya, a prominent hispanic leader
and selma, ala., last week saw a historically dramatic moment. the white mayor who had had dr. martin luther king and other civil rights activist arrested more than two decades ago welcomed jackson, a king protege and longtime civil rights activist, giving him the key to the city
mayor joe smitherman then joined jackson for a stroll through streets that saw some of the most tense moments of the civil rights struggle
the mayor said he was wrong to oppose the civil rights movement and while he's not officially endorsing jackson, he supports his message. the message, powerfully hammered home in jackson's stump speech, is:
_that ``the new south'' is one of equal civil rights but economic inequity
_that greater efforts are needed to fight the drug influx, the no. 1 national security threat
_that multinational corporations are to blame for loss of u.s. jobs because they take their business to cheap labor markets overseas
_that corporate agribusiness is to blame for squeezing the family farm
_that the minimum wage should be increased, and health care and day care programs are needed for the poor
_that overall hemispheric cooperation is needed to help ease latin nations' debts, increase u.s. exports and make peace with cuba and nicaragua
this is a referendum on economic violence,'' jackson says. ``people who are unemployed are rebelling. people who have jobs are insecure. people feel abandoned by the government.''
there also is considerable evidence that jackson is benefiting from being a celebrity in a contest where the other five candidates are a blur in many voters' minds
the other democrats have made multimillion-dollar media buys, compared to jackson's paltry $100,000 worth of ads in mostly non-major markets
jackson relies on the free media attention that follows him on his 18-hour campaign days, filled with tv-oriented events and photo opportunities
campaign manager gerald austin says the chartered dc-9 that carries the candidate and traveling press corps is jackson's media expenditure
it's always easy to spot a presidential contender going down the tubes in a primary election. he's the one noisily protesting that the other guy can't possibly get enough votes to win the white house
that's why sen. bob dole says vice president george bush can't win a national election for the republicans. and that's why aides to rep. richard gephardt and sen. albert gore jr. are beginning to whisper that michael dukakis would lead the democratic party to a resounding defeat in the fall
electablity is looming larger as the issue,'' dole said monday as he tried to stir up doubts about the vice president in alabama _ one of several super tuesday states where he looks like a landslide loser. ``we ought to nominate a winner instead of a loser.''
the unspoken message is that dole fears he is about to be swept under by a bush tide of ferocious proportions by the time the votes _ and the delegates _ are counted in the super tuesday contests
there will be more talk of that type in the days ahead. dole and his campaign aides are likely to produce polls, charts, graphs, senators, and an academician or two to explain why bush can't possibly win the presidential race in the fall
whether that will stem bush's surge in the nominating war now unfolding will have to wait for the decision of voters of illinois, ohio, pennsylvania and elsewhere
but curiously enough, the same play is being made against dukakis in the democratic race
gore's aide have begun to speak of a ``very real electability problem'' with dukakis, saying he has been unable to attract swing voters in the south who will be critical to democratic chances in the fall election
gephardt's advisers, even less charitable, have started to whisper alarmingly to reporters about a 50-state sweep next fall by the republicans if dukakis is the democratic nominee
such talk is designed to mask the prospect of a gore or gephardt failure in super tuesday _ possibly finishing behind not only dukakis, but jesse jackson, as well, and to lay out a rationale for remaining in the race
sen. paul simon's aides are attempting a variation on that theme, claiming that no matter what the outcome on super tuesday, dukakis will be unable to garner enough delegates to be assured of the nomination when the democratic convention opens in atlanta in july
in other words, don't ask simon why he took one look at the south and hustled back home to illinois, passing up even a chance at most of the 1,307 delegates at stake
even before the first curtain is pulled aside to admit a voter to a super tuesday polling booth, one outcome seems certain
super tuesday was conceived as a chance for the south to rise again in democratic politics, a way to mobilize an entire region behind a white, moderate to conservative candidate _ preferably from the south _ and push him firmly along the path to the party's nomination
instead, the two men who most nearly fit that bill, sen. albert gore of tennessee and rep. richard gephardt, find themselves in a struggle for survival in the race
the southern conservative political leaders made their stand in the final days of the super tuesday campaign. in a last bid to salvage something for their work. georgia sen. sam nunn, gov. joe frank harris and virginia gov. charles robb all made 11th-hour endorsements for gore
but the southerners' concern will be relegated to the back pages in a few days
dole will want the headlines to say that bush can't win a national election. dukakis' rivals will want the same thing said about him
unless, of course, the vice president and the massachusetts governor actually win their respective parties' nominations and fight it out for the white house in the fall election
then, the chances are that one of them will win

editor's note _ david espo covers the 1988 presidential campaign for the associated press
a spokesman for the rev. jerry falwell, who lost a lawsuit against larry flynt and hustler magazine over a crude satire, says portrayal of the case this week in the comic ``doonesbury'' is fair comment
i don't think anybody puts newspaper cartoons and the ad parody that was before the supreme court in the same ballpark or the same category,'' falwell spokesman mark demoss said from his office here
in a ruling viewed as a major victory for cartoonists who lampoon public figures, the u.s. supreme court last month threw out a $200,000 award a roanoke federal jury granted falwell in 1984 for emotional distress caused by the hustler ad parody, which portrayed falwell as a sexual deviant
in monday's ``doonesbury,'' cartoonist garry trudeau feigns a sigh of relief before cutting to a satire of evangelist jimmy swaggart's alleged sexual misconduct
dr. falwell's wife keeps a scrapbook of cartoons that mention him, so i'll take the scissors and cut this out and it will go into the scrapbook,'' demoss said
the editorial director for universal press syndicate said trudeau is not trying to prove that the court allowed him to sharpen his pen. ``garry's just doing what he's always done anyway,'' lee salem said from his office in kansas city, mo
producer joseph papp, founder and president of the new york shakespeare festival, says a musical opening on the campus of florida state university in june may be broadway bound
betsey brown,'' written by ntozake shange, will bring together papp's new york production team and university faculty and students to create a professional and educational experience, officials said monday
this is an unprecedented relationship. there's nothing like it nationally,'' said gil lazier, dean of the university's theater school
plans call for casting most of the major characters in new york, but some parts in tallahassee, and involving students in the development of sets, costumes and the musical score
papp said the musical may end up on broadway after three weeks in tallahassee beginning june 21 and short stops elsewhere
betsey brown'' tells the story of a young black girl growing up in st. louis in the 1950s
michael jackson and recent grammy winner jody watley led the nominations for the second annual soul train music awards
jackson was nominated monday for best single and album for ``bad'' and for best music video for his hit single, ``the way you make me feel.''
miss watley, the former singer with the group shalamar who won a grammy last week for best new artist, received nominations for best single and album in the female division and will compete against jackson in the music video category for her video, ``looking for a new love.''
others receiving multiple nominations were whitney houston, stevie wonder, natalie cole, prince, janet jackson and earth, wind &amp; fire
the winners will be named during a two-hour telecast march 30
three of the ``test-tube'' quintuplets of raymond and michele l'esperance left the hospital in a white limousine decorated with silver balloons to join the couple's three other children at home
a crowd of doctors, nurses and hospital administrators gathered monday to bid farewell to raymond jr., danielle and erica l'esperance, who have gained about 3 pounds each since their jan. 11 birth. danielle is the biggest at 6 pounds, 6 ounces, said nurse pamela wells of william beaumont hospital
the other two babies, veronica and alexandria, should be able to go home in a few weeks, said dr. daniel batton
we can't wait to have the other two home. we'll just start getting down to being a family,'' said l'esperance, a corrections officer who has built a new, larger home in clarkston
the babies were the first quintuplets born in the united states after being conceived through in-vitro fertilization, which involves fertilizing eggs in the laboratory and implanting the embryos in the womb
nobel laureate james tobin says he plans to retire from teaching this spring after 38 years as an economics professor at yale university
tobin, 69, served on president kennedy's council of economic advisers and won the nobel memorial prize in economic science in 1981 for his work on modern portfolio theory
a disciple of the late english economist john maynard keynes, tobin argues for government involvement in the economy and full employment. he is at odds with the reagan administration in his view that taxes should be increased to reduce the federal deficit
a management shakeup at the national basketball association's sacramento kings moved coach bill russell from the bench to the executive suite
russell, 54, said monday that gregg lukenbill, general managing partner and part owner of the club, suggested replacing him with assistant coach jerry reynolds, 44, to try to turn around the team's 17-41 win-loss record
russell said he agreed it was time for a change, and was looking forward to becoming vice president in charge of basketball operations, a recruiting post
every time we lost a game, it was a real hard kick in the stomach,'' russell said, flanked by reynolds and lukenbill at a news conference. ``i don't sleep after we lose and, you know, i've had a lot of sleepless nights,'' he added, his voice quivering and his eyes appearing moist. ``the losses _ i haven't been able to handle that.''
russell, a former five-time nba most valuable player, was named coach last year with the understanding he would be on the bench for two to four years and then move to the front office
amanda mcbroom, the one-time grammy nominee who has performed ``the rose'' in front of audiences of 60,000, clutched a microphone and stood under a fluorescent light next to an old coffee urn
no, times aren't tough for mcbroom. but they are for the 75 people who listened politely in a drafty soup kitchen on the city's northern border
few have jobs, and fewer have a permanent place to live. entertainment, whether paying to see a movie or a musician, is out of the question, so once a week professional entertainers come to them, singing a song or telling a joke to a poor but grateful crowd
i'm really happy i was here,'' mcbroom as she retrieved her coat after a six-song set. in a few hours, nightclub patrons would pay $10 to hear what the soup kitchen regulars enjoyed free
it's a look at reality,'' mcbroom said. ``you think of the homeless as a faceless group. that's not so. they're the same as me, but they've had bad luck.''
the weekly entertainment at the soup kitchen, which doubles as the storefront good news community church, was the idea of the rev. bob tschannen-moran and his indefatigable volunteer, joyce heitler, who dishes out food each night
by day, she's a teacher and part-time publicist for various professional acts around chicago
we needed something around here that's more than just food,'' she said, dropping on a bench to wipe her hands in an apron. ``some people thought it was frivolous. they said our job was to feed the poor, not entertain them
well they're entitled to something extra once in a while. they've had hard lives,'' she said
besides mcbroom, the soup kitchen has provided a stage for free performances by chicago's famous second city comedy troupe, the lyric opera, magicians and puppeteers
it does my heart good to see people doubled over in laughter, especially when they don't have much to laugh about,'' tschannen-moran said recently. ``we don't pretend that this is solving any problems, but i do think, for a brief time, this program is lifting spirits.''
the soup kitchen, within earshot of the last train stop before evanston, is tucked between a coin laundry and fast eddie's soul food. last year, the kitchen served 20,000 meals five days a week, including 9,000 to people age 18 and younger
a glance around the tables at mealtime finds gap-toothed children sitting beside single mothers. the youngsters' pants are often ripped and their jackets dirty and worn. outside on a recent night the temperature was near zero
we're pretty much regulars,'' said carol barton, 31, pointing to her 10-year-old son, shaun
i'm a single mother on public aid. people on my type of income can't afford entertainment. you have to use your imagination,'' she said. ``this is a bonus in life. it gives you a chance to survive the rest of the week.''
after 30 minutes, mcbroom has taken her bows. there is another evening engagement, but she still has a few minutes to sign autographs and answer questions
bette midler is best known for singing ``the rose'' in the movie of that name, but mcbroom wrote the lyrics. although the listeners couldn't offer her roses, each table in the soup kitchen had a soda pop bottle with water and carnations
how many times have you done `the rose?''' mcbroom was asked
a million times,'' she replied, ``but never to a more grateful bunch. this is a very classy group here. good night.''
the head of the environmental protection agency says restrictions on driving may be necessary to meet clean air standards in large cities, but such limitations shouldn't be determined in washington
i can make decisions at the federal level to establish regulations for certain industries, to establish regulations for each individual car's emission control equipment,'' epa chief lee m. thomas told a meeting of the national association of counties on monday. ``but if we look at smog in our major cities in the future, that's not going to be enough.''
sixty-two cities are on epa's list of non-complying areas for ozone, a key constituent of smog that worsens breathing problems. many will slide into compliance as older, more polluting cars are junked, but the worst cities _ perhaps 20 _ are bound to have serious problems ever meeting the standard, epa officials have said
ozone is formed by the interaction in sunlight of certain hydrocarbon and other compounds with nitrogen oxides, a product of combustion in motor vehicles, factories and power plants. the hydrocarbons can be unburned gasoline from cars, other compounds from industrial sources and even aerosol propellants. to reduce ozone formation in urban areas, scientists believe reductions in hydrocarbons must precede reductions in nitrogen oxides
at the moment the compliance question is in limbo as members of congress wrestle with revisions to the clean air act in back-room negotiations. congress has imposed a moratorium until aug. 1 on penalties against non-complying areas
telling county officials that ``the easy days are over'' in pollution control, thomas said ``in the long term we'll be right back at making the tough choices about how we are going to meet those standards.''
i can't have full responsibility in washington of establishing a uniform system of regulations and controls when in fact i've got such a diverse group of sources, when the smog problem may well need to be dealt with by reducing the number of cars on the street, by telling people they can't drive nearly to the extent they have in the past,'' thomas said
epa made stabs in the early 1970s at reducing auto use in urban areas, notably boston and los angeles, but public and congressional opposition prompted the agency to backpedal
thomas, who has said before that a serious commitment to the current standards might have to mean cutting down driving, evidently expects opposition again
in the smog and other programs, he said, ``the public will demand of all levels of government far more information on what do these sources do in terms of cost, in terms of degradation of the environment or degradation of their health, and on the other hand what do our programs do for them in terms of benefits and is it worth it to go forward with these programs.''
farmland prices nationally are headed up for the first time in six years, but an agriculture department analyst says there still are areas where land values are lagging
we're thinking there are going to be rather strong increases in the corn belt states and in the northeast,'' says roger hexem of the department's economic research service. ``we're less certain what's going to happen in the south and in the west.''
hexem's analysis came in an interview and in a report written for the march issue of agricultural outlook magazine
the department is scheduled to issue its annual farmland value report on april 14, showing average market prices as of feb. 1 for the united states as a whole and for each state
a year ago the feb. 1 values showed u.s. farmland, including buildings, were worth an average of $548 per acre, an 8 percent drop from 1986 to a 19-year low. farmland nationally rose to a peak of $823 per acre in 1982 before starting to slide
when inflation is accounted for, the ``real'' value of farmland declined even longer, from a 1981 peak of $551 per acre to $290 as of feb. 1, 1987
but a lot has changed during the past year, including some brightening of the dreary farm export situation, improved market prices for some commodities and the massive idling of highly erodible land under the government's conservation reserve program, or crp
nationwide, i'm thinking it's going to be up,'' hexem said. ``but i don't know how much.''
there are still ``soft'' areas where land market prices are lagging, he said. some states are gaining faster than others, and it also depends on what kind of agricultural enterprises prevail
within the corn belt, for example, i think that there are some indications that iowa will show a pretty good increase, where another state, like missouri, might not show as strong an increase,'' hexem said
in texas and oklahoma, for example, the economy is ``still kind of soft, so i think that has dampened demand on the part of the non-agricultural purchasers'' of farmland, hexem said. on the other hand, improved cotton prices probably strengthened land values in cotton-producing areas
another factor has been the long-term payments under crp, where farmers can get annual rental payments for planting grass and trees on fragile land. those payments have been averaging around $50 per acre each year for the 10-year life of the contracts
in his report, hexem cited survey results from a number of sources that point to rising farmland values. last november, for example, more than 500 farmland experts, all members of the american society of farm managers and rural appraisers, were surveyed by the university of wisconsin for the usda agency
over one-third of the respondents indicated that land values rose during the august-october (1987) quarter, while over one-half considered values unchanged,'' hexem said. ``less than a tenth indicated lower values.''
those reponses ``point to a strengthening of the market'' since last may, june and july, when only 28 percent thought farmland values had gone up and nearly 18 percent thought they had dropped, he said
for november, december and january, the rural appraisers expected continued increases in farmland values, hexem said. surveys last august, september and october by several federal reserve banks tend to support the national survey by the appraisers
the federal reserve bank of chicago, representing iowa and parts of illinois, indiana, wisconsin and michigan, reported that values for good farmland increased just over 3 percent during the third quarter, compared with a 2 percent gain in the preceding quarter,'' he said
but ``some uncertainties remain'' in the 1988 land market, hexem said. on the up side, demand for farm products is rising, and there are more manageable inventory levels. the crp ``seems to be strengthening prices for lower-quality land in some areas.''
on the down side, farm income is forecast to be down from last year's record level, in which federal payments accounted for 30 percent of the net cash income of farmers. crop target prices and price support loan rates will be down about 3 percent in 1988, and current legislation calls for further reductions in 1989
credit for buying land is available, but interest rates edged slightly upward in late 1987 and could go higher in 1988 if monetary policy is tightened to support the price of the dollar,'' hexem said
average incomes have dropped 25 percent in the countries of black africa during the 1980s, according to the latest figures from the world bank
the seriousness of the short-term economic outlook ... must not be underestimated,'' eugene v.k. jaycox, the bank's vice president for africa, said in a speech monday to the united nations advisory panel on africa
the bank released 1987 figures showing incomes were down by 4 percent from a year earlier. that drop followed a more than 2.7 percent decline reported for 1986 and an average annual decline from 1980-85 of 3.7 percent
exports and imports both declined for the year, but there was a 1.6 percent improvement in prices that africans got for their products, compared with what they had to pay for foreign goods. that was a lot better than 1986, when there was a drop of 25.2 percent
gerard rice, a world bank spokesman, said its economists are looking for a better year in 1988 with the average income holding steady. some countries have had continuous declines since they won independence in the 1960s
the figures cover what the bank calls ``sub-saharan africa,'' which includes the whole continent except for south africa and the northern tier countries algeria, egypt, libya, morocco and egypt
carol lancaster, who deals with africa at the institute for international economics, said the countries in worst shape are those hit by war and drought, such as angola, ethiopia and mozambique. the institute is a private study group financed largely by the west german marshall fund
nigeria, the most populous country on the continent and the one with by far the biggest economy, has been hurt by the drop in the price of oil, its dominant export. the decline in its income has a big effect on the overall figure
the world bank is the single biggest source of loans to improve living standards in the third world. in 1985 treasury secretary james a. baker iii said the bank should take the lead in planning new programs with heavily indebted countries. since then it has been giving more emphasis to broad lending programs, though the majority of its loans are still for individual projects
for the year ending june 30, it is expected to lend africa $5 billion
the international monetary fund, the bank's sister organization, is expected to make another $1.5 billion worth of loans at minimal interest
but the united nations advisory panel on africa said the continent also needs about $1 billion a year in relief from its old debts, most of them to governments, and another $1 billion in new aid
africa's $200 billion dollar debt is less than half latin america's, but its population is poorer, smaller and growing fast. discrimination</head>
the supreme court is beginning another examination of sex discrimination in the american workplace, agreeing to decide how difficult it should be for employers to disprove charges of sexist stereotyping
setting the stage for an important ruling likely to be announced in 1989, the justices on monday said they will hear an appeal by price waterhouse, one of the nation's leading accounting firms
the company is accused of allowing sexism, some of it perhaps unconscious, to play a key role in denying a woman a partnership in the firm
a federal appeals court placed a heavy burden on the firm to disprove the sex bias charges
price waterhouse, one of the nation's so-called ``big eight'' accounting firms, is accused of discriminating unlawfully against ann hopkins. she quit the firm's office here after she was denied promotion to partnership, a move that would have made her a part owner
ms. hopkins joined the firm in 1978 and was nominated for partnership in 1982, the only woman among 88 candidates for partnership that year. at the time, the company had more than 660 partners in 90 offices nationwide
ms. hopkins had been very successful in getting business for the company, winning government contracts worth an estimated $34 million to $44 million
of the 88 candidates in 1978, 47 were invited to become partners; 21 were rejected outright; and 20 including ms. hopkins were placed on hold
the following year she was told she would not become a partner and she resigned in 1984 to set up her own consulting firm
both her critics and supporters at price waterhouse said she sometimes was overly aggressive, too harsh, impatient with her staff and very demanding
one critic suggested she needed to take a ``course at charm school.''
a partner in the firm who urged her promotion told her she would stand a better chance of becoming a partner if she would ``walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.''
others said her use of profanity was a black mark against her
ms. hopkins then sued price waterhouse, accusing the company of violating title vii of the 1964 civil rights act prohibiting on-the-job sex discrimination. she said that sex stereotyping, unconscious or otherwise, barred her from being named partner
the supreme court ruled in 1984, in the case of a woman denied partnership in a law firm, that professional partnerships are covered by the 1964 law
a federal judge ruled price waterhouse must prove ``by clear and convincing evidence'' it would not have made her a partner regardless of whether sexual stereotyping played a part in its decision
price waterhouse did not provide such proof
the u.s. circuit court of appeals here last august said there is ``competent evidence that ... the partnership selection process at price waterhouse was impermissibly infected by stereotypical attitudes toward female candidates.''
the appeals court said even if there is evidence that ms. hopkins' personality played a part in her denial of partnership, price waterhouse is unable to prove ``impermissible bias was not the determinative factor.''
the appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what back pay and other remedies the company must provide
in other matters, the court:
_ruled that companies have a heavy burden of proof when defending themselves against investor lawsuits alleging the companies withheld information about merger discussions
_agreed to decide whether states may use anti-racketeering laws to close down adult bookstores accused of selling obscene materials. the court said it will review free-speech challenges to indiana's racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law, patterned after the much-used federal rico act
_agreed to use a case from canton, ohio, to try again to decide whether cities may be sued successfully by citizens who say their rights were violated by inadequately trained city employees
_ruled that financially troubled farmers may not avoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to pay back debts by using their labor and expertise while continuing to operate their farm
_said it will decide in a case from chicago whether a criminal defendant's right to a jury selected from a cross-section of the community is violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their race. murkier</head>
as voters went to the polls today in 20 states, a survey suggested that jesse jackson was leading in seven southern states, albert gore jr. was ahead in three states and michael dukakis was in front in the two states with the biggest delegate prizes, texas and florida
the abc news poll, based on interviews with 8,659 voters last thursday through sunday in all 16 states holding primaries today, also found rep. richard gephardt ahead only in his home state of missouri
in its survey released monday night, abc said dukakis's lead in texas was ``paper-thin'' over jackson and gephardt, who were tied for second in the state. but dukakis had a strong lead in florida, as well as back home in massachusetts and rhode island
on the republican side, abc said the poll indicates today's events look ``like a blow-out for george bush in virtually all states except missouri.''
overall, in the dozen southern states with primaries, bush led bob dole, 60 percent to 20 percent, followed by pat robertson at 12 percent and jack kemp at 4 percent. four percent were undecided
among the democrats in the south, jackson led with 29 percent to dukakis's 25 percent, with gore in third at 21 percent and gephardt fourth with 13 percent. gary hart was fifth at 5 percent, followed by paul simon at 2 percent. four percent were undecided and 1 percent supported other candidates
abc said the southern state results had a margin of error of three percentage points in either direction, but the samples for the non-southern states were too small to generate specific figures for the candidates
it also said the horse-race figures for the entire south were somewhat misleading because the two largest states, texas and florida, make up a large share of the vote. it said jackson led in most of the deep south, with gore, the tennessee senator, running second
it said jackson's strongest leads were in alabama and mississippi, where nearly half the voters polled said they support him. he also led among voters polled in arkansas, georgia, louisiana, north carolina and virginia. jackson was second in tennessee behind gore and second in florida and maryland behind dukakis, and tied for second with gephardt in texas
dukakis led among the voters abc polled in florida, maryland, massachusetts, rhode island and texas. abc said dukakis seemed to be headed for second in virginia behind jackson, while he was in tight battles for second with gore in arkansas, louisiana and north carolina
gore had strong leads in tennessee and kentucky and a thin edge in oklahoma, where abc said gephardt was ``running only slightly behind him.''
gephardt was ahead in the poll only in missouri and second just behind gore in oklahoma and second to gore in kentucky. gephardt and jackson were tied behind dukakis in texas. abc said gephardt was running fourth in most of the other states and was in danger of falling below the 15 percent threshold for delegates in a dozen of the 16 primary states
in an earlier abc news poll completed feb. 28, jackson led dukakis across the south by just 26 to 25 percent, followed by gore with percent, gephardt 13 percent and hart 7 percent. simon had 3 percent, 6 percent were undecided and 1 percent were for others
abc said dukakis has lost a bit of support in the deep south to gore, but gore has not been able to pull off the southern sweep his strategy called for
it said bush's 60-20 lead over dole region-wide is paced by the vice president's strong showings in texas and florida. bush was the choice of about 40 percent of those polled in missouri, and 70 percent in texas. ``in most states he is getting more than 50 percent of the vote against his three rivals,'' abc said
dole averages in the low 20s across the south, while robertson averages 12 percent. kemp averaged only 4 percent in the southern states. kemp's best states in the poll were massachusetts and rhode island, where he was the choice of about 10 percent of those polled. primaries</head>
for the democratic party's most prominent non-candidates, super tuesday marks a milestone _ it's too late to step in and win the presidential nomination through the primaries
by the numbers, it just can't be done
that's not to say that new york gov. mario cuomo, new jersey sen. bill bradley or georgia sen. sam nunn couldn't wind up with the nomination. but as of wednesday, they would have to get it by making political deals with the announced candidates for delegates or by swaying a deadlocked national convention
neither scenario can be ruled out because none of the three has ruled out accepting a draft for the nomination. cuomo has gone so far as to say he would accept such a draft at a deadlocked convention if party leaders made it his ``obligation.''
just last week, former president jimmy carter said there was an even chance that no democrat would clinch the nomination before the july convention in atlanta
there will be 4,160 delegates to the national convention and 2,081 are needed to win the nomination. with the passing of super tuesday there will be 2,279 delegates available from the 31 primaries and caucuses that remain
however, the problem for any late-starting candidate is that most of the filing deadlines to get on the later primary ballots will have passed with super tuesday
a new candidate could get on primary ballots in just five states, participate in caucuses in six other states, in caucuses for democrats in guam and the virgin islands and in a primary for democrats living elsewhere outside the united states
in all, by winning 100 percent of the delegates available in all those post-super tuesday contests qualified for, the candidate would wind up with 628 delegates going into the convention
cuomo, talking about the mathematics of a late start, said: ``number one, you can't do it. number two, it's irrelevant because i wouldn't anyway.''
the major contests still open after super tuesday are the june 7 primaries in new jersey and california. the filing deadlines are march 24 for california and april 13 for new jersey
in california, some democrats are trying to collect enough signatures to get cuomo's name on the ballot. in new jersey, meanwhile, a group of prominent, pro-bradley democrats announced late last month that it would attempt to run an uncommitted slate of delegates in the june 7 primary to give bradley strength at the national convention, if he wanted it
in new york, a group of pro-cuomo democratic county clerks has already qualified an uncommitted slate for the state's april 19 primary even though cuomo asked them not to do it. the new york primary is for 255 delegates
by getting into some of the later primaries, such as california and new jersey, a new candidate could demonstrate strength among the electorate
cuomo says the nomination shouldn't go to someone who hasn't been tested in the primaries. the candidates already in the race share that sentiment
if i lose the nomination, i want to be eliminated by someone who has played in the same league,'' said jesse jackson late last year when asked about a possible cuomo convention draft
nonetheless, nunn said last week that if no clear favorite emerges from super tuesday, the pressure will increase on cuomo and the other prominent non-candidates. also last week, former virginia gov. charles robb said cuomo was the only non-candidate who could possibly capture the nomination at a deadlocked national convention
while robert beckel, democrat walter mondale's 1984 campaign manager, said he thinks the nomination will go to one of the current crop of candidates, he also said ``there's a possibility of chaos.''
you will hear about a cuomo run between now and june 7, i'm convinced of that,'' said beckel. ``whether it will happen or not, i'm much less convinced.''
david garth, the new york-based political consultant and occasional cuomo adviser, said he doesn't expect any immediate move from the new york governor
i think he's going to do nothing until the convention. i think it's going to the convention and at that point he's got some very difficult decisions to make,'' said garth. ``he's going to have a difficult time at the point saying no.''
political organizers for gop presidential hopeful pat robertson have been asking local pastors to use church bulletins to solicit support for their candidate, robertson aides acknowledged monday
i don't think it's out of line,'' said henry hughes, robertson's chief organizer in new york state. ``we are not taking up collections in church like (jesse) jackson's campaign.''
he said pastors should be free to provide political guidance to their congregation as long as it does not actively involve the ``structure'' of the church
but several pastors in this rural upstate community disagreed
i very strongly object to that and i don't support endorsing any political candidate,'' the rev. d. gregory van dussen, pastor of the bergen united methodist church told the batavia daily news
van dussen said he received a letter from the regional committee of americans for robertson based in rochester asking for the use of church bulletins to announce its organizing meetings
he said the letter steered clear of asking for donations or recommendations from the pulpit
mainly it was for behind-the-scenes support,'' he said. ``they were asking us, somewhat diplomatically, to use church sponsorship and organize support for robertson.''
the letter, according to the pastor, said that robertson was a christian candidate presenting the views of christians and that ``christians of like mind would support him.''
robertson, a former baptist minister and television evangelist, scored well in the iowa primary last month, coming in second behind sen. bob dole. but his campaign has since faltered. he predicted a win in south carolina saturday, but came in a distant third behind vice president george bush and dole
van dussen said it was the first time he has ever received a letter asking for the church's political support. he said he has asked his fellow clergymen to refuse to allow the robertson campaign or any other campaign to use the church for political purposes
another pastor, douglas spencer of the first united methodist church in batavia, said, ``i didn't think the church should make that type of decision. the church contains people from various backgrounds. the letter sought institutional support for one candidate.''
al gore's strawberries ... bob dole's generic airliner ... jesse jackson's missing tree ... michael dukakis' hopes for a ``super martes'' ... george bush's return ``home''... richard gephardt's mom goes to bat..
vignettes from the campaign at the end of the long super tuesday trail:
paul simon wrote a book a few years ago called ``the tongue-tied american.'' it deplored americans' ignorance of foreign languages. it was written in english, the only language that simon speaks
by contrast, michael dukakis grew up in a home where both greek and english were spoken. he became fluent in spanish as a college student on visit to mexico and peru
dukakis put his language facility to good use before ``super martes,'' as he called it. he read a lesson in spanish at a televised mass in san antonio, and finished stump speeches across texas with the words: ``poco a poco. paso a paso. mano en mano. juntos. vamos a ganar.'' or, as he translated: ``little by little. step by step. hand in hand. together. we shall succeed.''
near the border with mexico, dukakis did not just sprinkle a few words of spanish into his speech: he delivered a five-minute portion in spanish after his english opening
like his rivals, al gore dashed back and forth across the southeast in the days leading up to today's primaries and caucuses in 20 states. he managed sometimes to touch down in half a dozen states or more in a single day
he traveled in a fleet of four or five lear jets, a curious caravan that made for speedy flying time but sometimes meant the candidate cooled his heels on the tarmac while waiting for his secret service agents and traveling press corps to land
gore's campaign couldn't afford a big jet and couldn't locate a mid-sized jet to accommodate the entourage of candidate, aides, secret service agents, reporters and television crews
gore earlier traveled in a single-prop airplane, a slow but comfortable aircraft not much younger than the 39-year-old candidate. but the campaign eschewed it after repeated mechanical breakdowns _ a couple times in flight
bush, by contrast, had a full-size chartered boeing 727 to carry his press corps _ which sometimes numbered so few the entire lot could sit in the first-class section. and did
that meant comfort and convenience for the travelers _ and sometimes staggering bills for their employers. campaign aides said the cost billed to news organizations was in the thousands of dollars a day for some days of heavy flying
campaign travel for reporters was feast or famine. jesse jackson's campaign press corps took a petition to the candidate to protest ``nutritional violence'' _ they weren't getting fed. he signed too, scrawling, ``let my people go.''
in gore's caravan of lear jets, the problem was too much food
there were platters of fresh strawberries as well as sandwiches, egg rolls, barbecue and chicken. on one day of travel, reporters noted they had faced five platters of food on five separate legs of travel, plus a bag-snack of submarine sandwiches for a midnight-flight snack
somehow, they managed to eat most of it
bob dole's campaign differed from the others in one striking way: no secret service. dole refused the protection, making a visible contrast with bush's almost imperial parade of escorts
dole traveled on the same plane with his troupe of reporters and sometimes wandered along the aisles to chat
his chartered airplane bore the words of its operating airline on one side: ``presidential airways.'' but some of the words were missing on the other side of the boeing 737 aircraft; it said just ``airways.''
this truly was the ``tarmac campaign.'' super tuesday eve sent three republican candidates to tulsa international airport within a four-hour period monday afternoon, but their paths never crossed. the scheduled did keep reporters crisscrossing the windswept tarmac, however
bush touched down in air force ii right on schedule at 12:05 p.m. and made quick work of a rally at an american airlines hangar. he toured the company's tulsa maintenance and engineering facility and talked briefly with reporters before lifting off again about 2 p.m
meanwhile, jack kemp took over a nearby hangar for a 12:30 p.m. news conference, then took off for oklahoma city, where he addressed the oklahoma legislature at 2:30 p.m
dole was taking off from oklahoma city about the same time kemp was speaking at the legislature. he arrived at a private business office at the tulsa airport for a 3:20 p.m. news conference
jesse jackson led his entourage through fieldcrest village, the spartan brick apartment complex in greenville, s.c. where he grew up as a boy
in fact, he said, ``i planted this tree right there.''
not so, the current residents told him. the tree he planted was struck a while back by lightning
in some ways, dukakis' super tuesday campaign has been southern in latitude only
while his democratic rivals were talking about grits and home fries, dukakis cracked jokes monday morning with a largely jewish crowd of senior citizens in north miami beach, fla., where many jews from the north have retired
there's nothing i like better than to walk on a cape cod beach and finish it off with a bowl of clam chowder,'' dukakis told the gathering, many of whom, no doubt, have been to the cape
`of course,'' he added, deferential to his audience, ``i don't have to worry about the dietary laws.''
rep. richard gephardt's longest-standing supporter _ his mother _ led the gephardt campaign in south florida on the eve of super tuesday. she faced rush-hour highway traffic on u.s. 1, posting herself at roadside with a sign: ``support my son.''
the 80-year-old loreen gephardt has stumped for gephardt in iowa, new hampshire, texas, south dakota, louisiana, georgia and alabama
the last four digits in my social security number are 1988. it's a good omen! a good omen!'' she said
vice president george bush, who worried aloud earlier this year that his supporters might be delayed at debutante balls or the country club, picked a prosperous section of houston to await the super tuesday election returns
bush, who long has fought the image of being a new england preppie, decided to hold his party tonight in the posh westin oaks hotel here
both westin oaks and the houstonian, where bush has a condominium he lists as his legal residence, are nestled in an opulent section west of downtown
republican rules in eight of today's super tuesday states could mean the biggest delegate prize for george bush, while bylaws and home-town contests for three of the democratic contenders may prevent an outright winner
bush, who currently has 126 delegates, could pad his lead considerably as the four gop candidates battle for 712 national convention delegates in 16 state contests, including virginia's non-binding primary
while the democrats allot delegates based on a percentage of the vote, republicans in eight super tuesday states _ alabama, florida, georgia, louisiana, maryland, mississippi, oklahoma and texas _ award delegates on a winner-take-all basis in each district and statewide
the vice president, who stands as the front-runner in many of those states, is expected to reap the benefits of the gop process
according to the latest polls, bush leads in 14 states that hold gop primaries or caucuses, including delegate-rich texas with 111, florida with 82, massachusetts with 52 and georgia with 48
the vice president also is ahead in alabama with 38 delegates, louisiana and maryland with 41 each, mississippi with 31, arkansas with 27, kentucky with 38, oklahoma with 36, rhode island with 21 and tennessee with 45
bush is even expected to win in rival pat robertson's home state of virginia, where no delegates are at stake on super tuesday
kansas sen. bob dole is hoping for some success in missouri, which has 47 delegates at stake, and north carolina with 54
according to the associated press survey, dole has 65 delegates heading into the super tuesday events while new york rep. jack kemp has 35 and former television evangelist robertson has 8. twelve delegates remain uncommitted
the democrats will be competing for 1,307 delegates in 21 states or territories. but the party requires that a presidential candidate reach a certain level of support to be eligible for winning delegates _ a system that decreases the chance of a clear-cut super tuesday winner
each candidate must receive at least 15 percent of the vote in any given congressional district or statewide
fueling the possibility of a four-way democratic race are contests in three of the candidates' home states _ michael dukakis' massachusetts, richard gephardt's missouri and albert gore jr.'s tennessee
dukakis, who leads the ap survey of delegates with 69.50, is counting on success in massachusetts with 98 delegates at stake, and possibly a large share of the delegates from florida with 136, maryland with 67, rhode island with 22 and washington with 65
dukakis' chief rival in florida is gephardt, who has obvious high expectations for missouri with 77 delegates, and hopes to do well in oklahoma with 46, and plans to fight it out in texas, which boasts the biggest prize _ 183 delegates
gephardt has 50 delegates so far, while gore has 21.80, jesse jackson 27.55, paul simon 35.50 and 258.65 remain uncommitted
jackson looks to do well in the south, especially in alabama with 56 delegates, georgia with 77, louisiana with 63, mississippi with 40 and perhaps hawaii with 20. jackson enrolled 2,000 new democrats in the island state
gore and gephardt are expected to be locked in a close race in arkansas with 38 delegates. gore is hoping to grab a large portion of delegates in kentucky with 55 at stake, nevada with 16, the obvious _ tennessee _ with 70, and virginia with 75
in north carolina, jackson, gore and dukakis are vying for 82 delegates, while in idaho, dukakis and gore are battling for 18 delegates although state officials would prefer an uncommitted slate
three democratic delegates are at stake in american samoa. service</head>
a federal judge's ruling will allow the regional bell telephone companies to offer consumers new computerized services that do the work telephone answering machines now do
in his decision, u.s. district judge harold greene said the risks that the local phone companies would monopolize the market were outweighed by the benefits this new service and others like it would provide consumers
what has until now been a relatively quiescent market is likely to become a broad, vigorous and competitive one'' that will make the service available to a broad base of consumers, he said in a 66-page decision monday
about 10 percent of american households use answering machines, he said
besides voice messaging, as it is called, the bell companies also could provide electronic mail services, which allow computer-to-computer transfer of messages, greene said
in addition, he outlined a set of computer ``gateway'' functions the companies can provide to guide a computer user to various information services. but he restricted these functions to services like data transmission, billing management and services that enable different computers to ``speak'' to each other
in so doing, he refused to retreat from his september ruling in which he said phone companies could transmit information services but could not generate or manipulate the content of the information
the bell companies generally praised greene's decision as a ``first step'' toward making a wide range of information services available to the public, but they said the judge didn't go far enough
we view this as a start, but only a start. we still are not allowed to provide content for information services,'' a bellsouth statement said
the bell companies have lobbied heavily for full participation in the information services market so they could provide services that would enable consumers with personal computers to bank and shop from home, make travel arrangements and even read newspapers
bell atlantic chairman thomas e. bolger said the company is ``particularly concerned'' that greene is continuing to forbid the bell companies from electronic publishing of yellow page phone directories
though greene's decision lifts the legal barrier to the bell companies' offering of voice messaging and electronic mail, the companies still would need state and federal regulatory approval before they could offer the services to consumers
industry experts and bell company officials say the computer software for these services has been developed and could be offered to consumers in some parts of the country within one to two years
greene, who oversees the antitrust decree that stripped american telephone &amp; telegraph co. of its bell operating companies four years ago, reiterated in his ruling that the baby bells should not be permitted to compete in content-based information services because they continue to control the local phone networks. with this advantage, he maintains, the bells could control the information services market

the new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 5.91 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,854.90 and 6.20 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,700.20
in a separate report, the federal reserve said monday that the average yield for one-year treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages held steady at 6.63 percent last week, the same as the rate for the previous week
fresh snow on the trail continued to slow the pace of the 1,150-mile iditarod trail sled dog race as mushers slogged their way down from the frosted peaks of the alaska range
on monday, jan masek of anchorage led a tightly grouped caravan of more than 20 mushers to rohn roadhouse, a remote log-cabin checkpoint 271 miles from the start in anchorage
masek arrived at 3:10 p.m., followed eight minutes later by lavon barve of wasilla. defending champion susan butcher arrived at 3:20 p.m., followed closely by jerry austin of st. michael and jacques philip of thomery, france
tim moerlein of kasilof pulled in at 3:31 p.m., trailed four minutes later by four-time iditarod champion rick swenson, in seventh position
by 8:30 p.m., half the 52 mushers in the race had made it to rohn. the rest were spread the 78 miles back to finger lake
racers were slowed by up to 6 inches of new snow as they mushed down to rohn from rainy pass, at 3,400 feet the highest point along the trail
rohn is a favorite point for mushers to take the 24-hour layover required of all mushers sometime during the anchorage-to-nome race. the isolated cabin provides a refuge from spectators and reporters, and the dogs often are tired from crossing the rugged mountains
the race, which started at 9 a.m. saturday, has been slower than last year's record-setting pace, when butcher reached nome after 11 days, 2 hours on the trail
the race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed diphtheria serum to nome during an outbreak of the disease. the top 20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. the winner will get $30,000. ^an ap extra</head>
panama's strongman, gen. manuel antonio noriega, is emphasizing class and racial distinctions in what appears to be an effort to rally support by polarizing society
the humble, the poor, the blacks, they are the utmost authority of this people,'' noriega, commander of the country's 15,000-strong defense forces, told a crowd friday in the provincial town of carriazo
his regime, under mounting economic pressure from the united states, has tried to characterize domestic opposition as rich and white. in government newspapers and on official radio and tv stations, noriega's opponents are termed ``oligarchs'' and ``sellouts.''
whiteys, to the firing squad,'' says graffiti scrawled on walls in some of this capital's more affluent neighborhoods. the message is signed vt, for victoria torrijista, a populist organization that reveres the late strongman omar torrijos
in speeches, noriega repeatedly invokes torrijos _ killed in a 1981 airplane crash _ as inspiration for his defiance of washington
vt, like all groups supportive of the defense forces' de facto rule, is subsidized by the government, according to former government officials now at odds with noriega
panama, with 2.2 million people, is a racially mixed nation with african, indian and european heritage. as is the case throughout latin america, people of european or predominantly european heritage are generally better off than descendants of those their forefathers conquered or enslaved
compared with the rest of the region, there is a relatively large middle class. but there is also a big gap between rich and poor
the national civic crusade _ an opposition alliance of about 200 business, professional, political and labor groups _ has struggled to overcome the popular perception of it as representative of limited and privileged interests
in the dining room of the opulent marriott hotel, ernesto gonzalez de la lastra, a leader of the crusade, rose in response to a question about the government claim it is ``oligarchic.''
gonzalez de la lastra, in stylish clothes, a rolex watch gleaming on his wrist and gold chain around his neck, escorted foodworkers' union official martin gonzalez, in humbler garb, to the table
i'll let don martin answer that,'' said the president of the association of panamanian executives
oligarchy means government by the few,'' said the union man from a working-class district just outside the capital of panama city. ``so the defense forces and their government is the real oligarchy.''
noriega does not hold pro-government demonstrations at the marriott, and those who attend rallies supporting him are poorer than the drivers of the cars that join the crusade's occasional protest caravans through town. but the opposition has significantly broadened its appeal
noriega tries to represent himself as the standard-bearer of the poor,'' said dedys ramos, saleswoman at a clothing store in the downtown area. ``but it is the poor who suffer more than anyone because of him.''
from a lower-class neighborhood, mrs. ramos earns just above the minimum wage of $150 a month and is an adamant opponent of the regime
referring to the beginnings of hardship _ including the closure of banks last week _ resulting from u.s. economic pressure on panama, she said:
he (noriega) is not going to go without. he has food and a roof. but what about those abuelitos (little grandfathers) who can't cash their paltry pension checks? that's why you can see me out there waving my white hankie with the civilistas (civic crusade backers).''
supporters of the civic crusade, which has spearheaded opposition to noriega since its formation in june, wave white handkerchiefs at their demonstrations
a gallup poll taken in august indicated that nearly 75 percent of panamanians would like to see noriega out
a power struggle earlier this month between noriega and ousted president eric arturo delvalle sparked the current crisis
noriega loyalists in the national assembly dismissed delvalle feb. 26, a day after delvalle had tried to fire noriega
noriega was indicted last month in florida on federal drug trafficking charges. he has denied those accusations

cosi fan tutte'' may be difficult to sing, but one wouldn't have known that from the performance given monday night as the mozart opera was heard at the metropolitan opera for the first time in three years
because all the singers paid such rapt attention to their vocal lines, instead of tossing them off, the opera in which two men, on a dare, disguise themselves as foreigners and woo each other's sweetheart, was more serious than it sometimes is. and it was sung glowingly!
one felt the women's real attempts not to fall for the new men _ and the men's pain when they did. in contrast to what happened in the 1984-85 season, this time the couples paired up as they began. last time, they stayed as they had switched around
the cast of six principals provided a gem of an evening as james levine conducted
dame kiri te kanawa, from gisborne, new zealand, sang fiordiligi
susan quittmeyer of new york impressed as one who should be heard again when she made her met debut earlier this season in ``the tales of hoffmann.'' that impression was correct. as dorabella, she held her own beside dame kiri. they made a splendid pair and blended beautifully
also splendid were the suitors, baritone hakan hagegard of karlstad, sweden, engaged to fiodiligi, and tenor david rendall of london engaged to dorabella
it was good to have hagegard's fine voice back at the met; he last was heard here as wolfram in ``tannhauser'' four years ago. rendall is a veteran in ``cosi'' at the met and sounds even better in it than before. his voice abosolutely floated
carlos feller, from tarnopol, poland, made his met debut as don alfonso, who bets the two men that their sweethearts won't stay true to them. the bass has been a member of the cologne opera since 1969. his tones are round and open and he seemed right at home. he has sung the part at the glyndbourne festival and the washington opera and recorded it
dawn upshaw, from nashville, was another delight, as the maid. she was singing instead of hei-kyung hong, who was originally announced
set designer hayden griffin solved the problem of an opera with six principal singers on a huge stage by setting action inside a large wooden frame on the met stage. simply and effectively, side panels were turned for indoor or outdoor scenes
the evening had a minor problem with hats. in the first scene, dame kiri had difficulty taking hers off, then it fell to the floor. then the easel on which miss quittmeyer's hat rested clattered over. later, hagegard's fur busby fell off. but nobody missed a beat. shipyard workers' participation in caucuses</head>
washington state has filed suit in federal court to challenge a navy claim that its civilian shipyard employees are barred by the federal hatch act from participating in today's presidential precinct caucuses
u.s. district judge jack tanner promised a ruling this morning
the state's suit contends that prohibiting federal workers from speaking at their party caucuses unconstitutionally violates their right to free speech, said david bryant, a spokesman for the washington secretary of state's office
bryant said the suit asks tanner to clarify the intent of the hatch act by interpreting ``conflicting sections'' of the regulations
a bill to revise the hatch act and allow workers to participate in partisan political activities on their own time overwhelmingly passed the u.s. house of representatives last year. it is still pending in the senate
the hatch act regulates political activities of federal workers
officials at the puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton told workers recently they can attend the political caucuses scheduled in neighborhoods across washington state tonight, but cannot discuss candidates
in washington, the precinct caucuses are the first step in the months-long process leading up to a selection of delegates to the national presidential nominating conventions this summer. at stake ultimately: 73 democratic national convention delegates and 41 gop delegates
the caucuses provide the only opportunity for most washington voters to express a preference for a presidential candidate
obviously, addressing the caucus is part of the activity,'' said james sommerhauser, representing professional and technical engineers local 12 in bremerton, but ``most federal employees are so intimidated by the hatch act they're afraid to participate.''
sommerhauser said his union represents 1,800 federal workers at the yard and elsewhere in kitsap county. the yard employs 11,600 people
rep. norm dicks, d-wash., whose district includes the shipyard, said over the weekend that the navy's ``outrageous'' claim that its civilian shipyard employees can't participate in the caucuses is one more good reason to change the hatch act
dicks commented after leaders of both major political parties said they thought the navy order violated free speech guarantees
shipyard spokesman bruce andrae earlier defended the order on the basis of the hatch act
that law includes one provision allowing a government employee to ``express his opinion as an individual privately and publicly on political subjects and candidates.''
but another provision cited by the navy forbids ``addressing a convention, caucus, rally or similar gathering of a political party in support of or in opposition to a partisan candidate for public office.''
yard workers learned of the issue when they read a page 1 article in the feb. 25 edition of the base newspaper that said: ``when the caucus discussion in favor of one candidate or another is held, you may not participate.''
laura baumgaertner, a spokeswoman for the washington, d.c., office of the merit system protection board, which enforces the law, agreed the law bars government workers from speaking up at caucuses
the soviet union's surprise call for security council condemnation of the iran-iraq ``war of the cities'' was greeted by western skepticism and renewed u.s. calls for an arms embargo against iran
iraq said the u.n. body should stick to its cease-fire resolution, while iran supported the soviet proposal and called again for condemnation of iraq
under the circumstances, the security council has to do something in order to eliminate the damage of the further escalation of the military conflict between iran and iraq,'' soviet ambassador alexander m. belonogov told reporters monday after closed-door security council consultation
but when asked whether the soviet union would approve an arms embargo, he did not reply directly and said more diplomatic efforts were needed
iran and iraq, fighting a 7{-year-old war, have fired dozens of missiles at each other's cities since last tuesday, killing hundreds of civilans
u.s. ambassador herbert okun told reporters after council consultations that a soviet resolution on the ``war of the cities'' should not ``undercut or erode'' security council resolution 598 of july 20 which demanded an immediate cease-fire and provided for sanctions against the belligerents
we don't need a new resolution. we need observance of the resolution which is already in front of us,'' he said
the united states has been pushing for an arms embargo against iran, and the 15-member security council is working on an embargo, but it has not been approved
iran on monday again called on the security council to condemn iraq for escalating the latest round of missile bombardment of tehran and baghdad
iraq is trying to spoil the atmosphere for a political settlement by escalating the current conflict,'' said iran's acting ambassador, mohammad ja'afar mahallati
the iraqi ambassador, ismat kittani, told reporters after the council session that his government will insist the council act within resolution 598 and that other action sought by the soviet union be secondary
moscow has been under international pressure to agree to punitive action against iran, or both belligerents. it has been wooing iran and is reluctant to impose an embargo against the tehran government
western diplomats said the new soviet proposal might be intended to deflect world criticism, delay an arms embargo resolution by the council and portray moscow in a positive light as an initiator of a strong peace proposal
some of the missiles used by both iran and iraq have been made in the soviet union, according to experts. but the soviet union denies that iraq is using soviet-made missiles in its bombardment of tehran
the soviet ambassador said he expected a meeting on the soviet request today or wednesday, but none was scheduled
jerry burns, editor of the san francisco chronicle's editorial page and a respected newsman at the paper for more than 20 years, has died of cancer at age 51
burns, who first sought care for his illness in august, died early monday at his home here with his family by his side
burns held several important positions during his career at the chronicle, including city hall reporter, chief political correspondent and city editor
former mayor dianne feinstein remembered burns' ``wonderful sense of humor, twinkling eyes and sharp wit.''
he was really concerned about what happened to the city,'' said feinstein, whose career burns covered. ``if his byline was on a story, it was reported fairly and squarely.''
chronicle editor and publisher richard t. thieriot said burns was ``universally beloved'' at the paper
as a journalist, jerry always saw both sides of complex issues fairly and objectively, and he maintained a solid intellectural integrity in the editorial pages,'' thieriot said
burns, who was born in hollywood on nov. 28, 1936, graduated in 1958 from the university of southern california. he later received a master's degree in journalism from university of california, los angeles
after working for the santa monica evening outlook, he was hired at the chronicle in 1964 as a night police reporter
three years later, burns was given the city hall beat, and in 1976, he was promoted to chief political correspondent. in 1979, he became city editor and in 1984 editorial page editor
survivors include his wife, marilyn burns, a son and daughter
a memorial service will be held thursday at temple emanu-el in san francisco
with a soviet deadline drawing closer, pressure is mounting on negotiators seeking a settlement to end the 9-year-old war in afghanistan
it remained uncertain monday whether pakistan, which is representing the afghan guerrillas and does not recognize the soviet-backed afghan government, will drop its demand for a broad-based transitional government to replace the existing regime after soviet troops withdraw
the transitional government could ensure the safe return of more than 5 million refugees from pakistan and iran because guerrillas vow to fight on if the soviet-backed government remains in power
sources close to the talks, which continue today, said the afghan government has shown some flexibility, giving hope that a compromise could be worked out, perhaps with pakistan signing the pact in return for assurances that an interim government would be formed within weeks
soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev says moscow will begin withdrawing its estimated 115,000 soldiers in mid-may if the accord is signed by mid-march
pakistani president zia ul-haq was quoted monday as saying an afghan peace accord must and will be signed soon
there is no question of the accord not going through,'' zia was quoted as telling the gulf news, a united arab emirates newspaper. ``allowing it to be dropped is no option.''
pakistan's chief representative in the peace talks, acting foreign minister zain noorani, said islamabad hopes for soviet cooperation, even though his country wants an interim government to replace the soviet-backed regime
it is in their interest, too, to see that there is peace and calm after they leave,'' said noorani after talks resumed monday after a weekend recess
a representative of the largest group in the seven-party alliance of moslem guerrillas reiterated on monday that the resistance is determined to fight on if a peace deal is struck on ``moscow's terms.''
speaking at a news conference, professor abdul kadir kariab said signing the settlement ``in the present shape will be a historic treason to the afghan people'' which he said was mourning 1.3 million dead
sources close to the u.n.-sponsored talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said negotiators seemed to remain cautiously optimistic that a peace package can be tied up by next week
they said the slow pace _ with monday meetings only during the morning _ did not indicate a deadlock
the talks moved speedily last week with agreement announced friday on the timetable and logistics of the proposed soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan. this had been, according to u.n. mediator diego cordovez, the last major ``difference of substance.'' lithuanian-american</head>
the state department has confirmed that the soviet union is not allowing lithuanian-american povilas peciulaitis to emigrate despite a statement last december that he would be free to leave, according to rep. edward feighan
feighan, d-ohio, urged secretary of state george p. shultz to quickly intervene and monday requested a meeting with soviet ambassador yuri dubinin. he also sent a letter to soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev asking that the matter be resolved quickly
they have the audacity to tell us now that it was a mistake,'' feighan said of the soviets. ``if the soviets think i'm going to stand by and meekly accept this broken promise, they had better think again.''
peciulaitis, 64, was born in lithuania and exiled to siberia for 22 years, but his parents were naturalized american citizens
feighan said he fears for peciulaitis' personal safety, adding that verbal attacks against the man have recently appeared in newspapers and on television in lithuania
the justice department's nazi-hunting unit has identified 9,800 people as former concentration camp guards and says it will have them placed on the immigration watch list of individuals to be barred from the united states
the office of special investigations compiled the names with the assistance of a sophisticated new computer database
names of suspected criminals and nazi persecutors are systematically checked against immigration records to determine if they are in the united states
the names of individuals not found to be in this country are included in the watch list to prevent them from entering
a provision of a federal law, known as the holtzman amendment, was invoked when austrian president kurt waldheim was placed on the watch list last year following a decision by attorney general edwin meese iii
osi has listed thousands of such people in the past few years. but the 9,800 now to be placed on the watch list of the u.s. immigration and naturalization service ``for serving as concentration and death camp guards is probably the greatest number'' to be added at one time, said the office's chief, neal sher
the united states would welcome participation by north korean athletes in the seoul olympics, according to a senior u.s. diplomat
the olympics would be better off if north korea chooses to participate,'' said assistant secretary of state edward derwinski. ``but time is running out.''
he added that ``we have nothing but a positive attitude'' toward participation by pyongyang
derwinski said monday the united states will have ``some additional naval units'' in the region at the time of the september olympic games. speaking at the u.s. information agency's foreign press center, he said the additional naval presence was ``a very timely, practical coincidence.''
other u.s. officials have said the additional presence probably will consist of one or two aircraft carriers
derwinski warned that any attempt by the north koreans to disrupt the games ``would make them a total pariah.'' north korea is one of only a handful of countries, including cuba, which is boycotting the games
an airport in gambia will become an emergency landing site for the space shuttle under a new agreement between the united states and the african nation
gambia, africa's smallest nation, is a narrow strip of mango grove swamps, no more than 30 miles wide and 200 miles long, that snakes in from the atlantic ocean on the western coast of africa. it is surrounded by senegal
under the agreement, signed monday by ambassador herbert horowitz for the united states and m.c. cham, minister of works and communications for the government of gambia, the national aeronautics and space administration will locate specialized navigational aids at banjul airport
the landing strip would be used if a failure or poor performance of rockets causes the shuttle to fall short of the speed needed to get into orbit
banjul airport is almost directly below the normal flight path of a shuttle launched into a standard orbit
interested in a staple gun that joins broken bones? how about a ceramic sushi knife that leaves no trace of that unpleasant metallic aftertaste? or maybe a robot caddy for golfing?
these and other innovations are on display at this year's national design and engineering show, intended to give engineers a vision of ``products of the future,'' said jim greif, a show spokesman
the theme of the maze of exhibits at the mccormick place exposition center is ``the impact of product design on global competitiveness,'' greif said
although our exports have gone up since the dollar's decline, they haven't gone up nearly as much as people had predicted,'' greif said. ``most american companies are not geared for selling abroad.''
take refrigerator exports, for example
the american refrigerator market was basically killed off'' because an 18-cubic-foot fridge won't fit in a typical kitchen in developing countries, said another show spokesman, dave dasgupta
if you send these bulky things abroad, you don't have a market for it,'' he said. by contrast, when the japanese began selling cars in the united states, they totally redesigned the interiors to suit americans' larger physiques and longer legs
the four-day show, which began monday and is sponsored by the american society of mechanical engineers, features exhibits by 763 companies from 40 states, japan, canada, austria and britain
among the more unusual products featured is the japanese-made ceramic knife
developed by kyocera corp. of kyoto, the knife is used by restaurants in japan but has not been marketed to consumers in this country, said joe lewis, a district sales manager for kyocera's american subsidiary
the $35 knife is made of zirconia, a ceramic material that is tougher than ordinary ceramics, lighter than steel, sharp enough to slice flesh and cuts a smoother, less jagged line than ordinary knives, lewis said
the staplizer surgical staple gun, introduced about a year ago, is being used by scores of hospitals in the united states and abroad, said design engineer edward p. skwor, who developed it for the orthopedic products division of 3m in st. paul, minn
with the press of a trigger, the hand-held gun punches office-sized staples into a broken bone, helping it heal in place, skwor said. the staples aren't removed
staples allow the surgeon to do his job quicker and easier,'' skwor said. when those patients are back on their feet, and if their budgets aren't quite depleted, they might find use for the $2,350 robot golf caddy, a remote-controlled device resembling a grown-up tricycle
the golfer simply attaches a small electronic transmitter to his waistband, and the caddy follows him around the course, carrying golf clubs, balls and even highballs while keeping a proper 3{ feet to 4 feet behind, said bill reilly, chief electronic engineer at gettig engineering in spring mills, pa
lawyers for a youth accused of bludgeoning a classmate to death for a thrill rested their case after psychiatrists gave conflicting testimony about whether the defendant had a chronic psychotic disorder
closing arguments were expected to be delivered this afternoon
rod matthews, 15, of canton, has admitted killing 14-year-old shaun ouillette, but defense attorneys contend matthews was unable to control himself because of a mental disorder aggravated by his use of a drug prescribed to hyperactive youths
prosecutors say matthews, who is on trial as an adult, clubbed ouillette to death with a baseball bat for a thrill
classmates have testified that matthews took them to view the body in a wooded area where it remained for three weeks after the november 1986 killing
dr. kenneth holbert, director of the state's gaebler children's center in waltham, testified that while matthews has had a long-term mental illness that may have contributed to his behavior, he should have been able to control his actions the day he killed ouillette
i don't believe he was suffering from a chronic psychotic disorder,'' holbert said. ``he could have used his cognitive strengths to behave in another manner.''
but dr. bernard yudowitz of belmont's mclean hospital said matthews ``was suffering from an atypical psychosis which in every manner impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the standards of law.''
matthews first decided to kill someone after viewing the videotape faces of death, which shows animal and human killings and tortures, said yudowitz. he said matthews' use of the drug ritalin may have made it harder for him to control himself
matthews did not kill for reasons of vengeance but ``to get rid of the urge to kill,'' said yudowitz, a former director of bridgewater state hospital
yudowitz said he knows of hundreds of cases in which children and adults are misdiagnosed as hyperactive and given ritalin
there is no way of knowing what the exact effect ritalin had'' on matthews, said yudowitz. ``there was a distinct possibility'' it contributed to a loss of impulse control, he said
assistant norfolk county district attorney peter casey questioned the methodical manner with which matthews approached the killing of ouillette and the cover-up of the killing
yudowitz said that the methodical nature of the act ``in no way contradicts the fact that rod matthews is an extremely sick individual. it's consistent with this boy having a disturbed mind.''
former friends have said matthews told them he wanted to see what it was like to kill someone. they said he named several potential victims before settling on ouillette
the teen-agers testified last week about viewing ouillette's body only hours after a pre-thanksgiving pep rally, then bicycling with matthews to a shopping mall pizza parlor for a snack. detail of new law, opposition leaders vowing to fight it. pickup 12th graf pvs ``differences on...''</note>
the governing democratic justice party declared its new set of election laws passed early tuesday despite attempts by members of the opposition to disrupt the national assembly session
the bill was passed in less than a minute after a plenary session was called at 2:10 a.m
deputy speaker chang sung-man declared it passed when members of the governing party on the floor said, ``no objection.''
opposition lawmakers had tried to stop passage by occupying the speaker's platform since the previous night. a pushing-and-shoving contest began when some governing party memebrs tried to remove them
chang had to use a back door to reach the podium
the governing party has 160 of the 276 seats in the national assembly, more than the simple majority required to pass the bill. assembly officials said they could not say immediately how many governing party lawmakers were present when the bill was declared passed, but most were believed to be there
opposition lawmakers protested the passage, but the spokesman for the governing party said it was unavoidable because the new constitution requires legislative elections to be held by april 28
the trouble was caused by a last-minute opposition demand to change some parts of the bill, including the the total number of lawmakers, poll watching in barracks and campaign methods
a new system of electing one lawmaker in each constituency instead of two is at the heart of the proposed changes. that would handicap the governing party in big cities and the opposition in rural areas, where there are far more election districts
the new bills would increase membership in the national assembly to 299
under the proposals, 224 members would be chosen by direct popular vote and 75 under a proportional system based on each party's total vote. the opposition wants to increase the number of lawmakers to more than 330
the new legislation also limits the number of campaign rallies in any district to three joint meetings including all candidates. it bans any rallies by individual parties, prohibits street campaigning with loudspeakers and would exclude appearances by national political leaders
opposition leaders said they would fight to overturn the sections of the law that limit campaigning, but it was unclear how they could succeed
differences on election laws have caused friction between the two main opposition parties. they hope to merge in time for the legislative election to avoid the defeat they suffered in december's presidential ballot by running rival candidates
they agreed on the new election formula last week, but a dispute over future leadership created a new split
kim young-sam's reunification democratic party said rival kim dae-jung must take a back seat in a new party, but kim dae-jung's party for peace and democracy described the demand as ``meddling in private matters.''
dr. william masters and virginia johnson have created a stir in the medical community with their latest book, but that's nothing new after more than 30 years of pioneering research into human sexuality
criticism of the couple's new book, ``crisis: heterosexual behavior in the age of aids,'' focused monday on its claim that the epidemic is ``running rampant in the heterosexual community.''
the authors acknowledged using a relatively small and unscientifically chosen sample of sexually active heterosexuals, but said they had enough information to sound an alarm about a group that may not realize how much it is at risk
their first landmark book, ``human sexual responses,'' is said to have radically changed the way sex is viewed
research for that book began in 1957 with an unprecedented seven-year study of sexual response, research that included the observation of volunteers and prostitutes engaged in intercourse or masturbation
many credit their research with helping spur the so-called sexual revolution and opening up human sexuality as a topic for mainstream newspapers and magazines
in 1970, masters and johnson's book ``human sexual inadequacy'' was a best seller. it carried the authors' assertion that 79 percent of their female patients treated for inability to reach a climax had responded successfully to therapy originated by masters and johnson
the book brought great attention to the masters and johnson institute of st. louis, a non-profit clinic where couples receive therapy for sexual dysfunction
in the early 1980s, two pyschologists from berkeley, calif., bernie zilbergeld and michael evans, challenged the masters and johnson claims of treatment success rates of nearly 80 percent. the critics said the couple had failed to disclose the criteria used for evaluating success
other therapists said they were unable to duplicate the masters and johnson success record even when using the couple's techniques
evans and zilbergeld made their first assault in psychology today in august 1980, accusing masters and johnson of ``research so flawed by methodological errors and slipshod reporting that it fails to meet customary standards _ even their own _ for evaluation research.''
zilbergeld claimed that in 1982, he and evans met masters at a professional conference and that masters spelled out his success criteria for treatment of sexual dysfunction in women: the woman should reach climax at least once during the two-week intensive therapy period and at least once again during a five-year follow-up period
masters has since denied making any such statement. he also has lashed out at critics and defended his research
in a field plagued by real and troubling problems which deserve the best effort of the best minds, it is indeed unfortunate that we must devote any energy to absurd allegations,'' masters said, as he defended his research before a scientific forum in washington, d.c., a few years ago
masters graduated from the university of rochester medical school and did his residency in 1943 at maternity hospital in st. louis. he then joined the faculty of the washington university medical school in st. louis
masters met johnson when the school's placement office sent her to interview for a job in the obstetrics and gynecology department
they began working together jan. 2, 1957, and married jan. 7, 1971. both had been married before
johnson, who once described herself as ``a perpetual student,'' said she pursued an advanced degree in social anthropology until about age 50, when she gave up
just when i got things going academically, he would start something spectacular and he would suggest that i might be on hand for it.''

on the tokyo stock exchange, the 225-share nikkei stock average, which fell 10.99 points monday, lost another 150.85 points, or 0.59 percent, ending the day at 25,465.73. volume was 800 million shares, light compared with last friday's turnover of 1.3 billion
dealers said the dollar's lower opening reflected its decline monday on overseas markets, where traders sold dollars to buy british pounds because of higher interest rates in britain
the u.s. currency rose slightly during tokyo trading because of profit-taking and covering of dollar-short positions by traders, they added
a lack of follow-up selling from corporate players including japanese exporters is prompting traders to cover short positions,'' said masaharu takenaka, a senior currency trader for the bank of tokyo
the weaker dollar dragged down prices on the stock exchange, where traders stayed on the sidelines waiting for a market adjustment following recent sharp gains
the market is clearly very tired,'' said ron napier, a vice president at salomon brothers. he said rising interest rates also have dampened buying sentiment in tokyo. ``we've seen a very dull market, and that's the way it's going to be for a while,'' he said. test scores</head>
a 12-state study found that advanced math and science courses and family income were more important factors than ethnicity in how hispanic high school students scored on college entrance tests
the study of 1,928 hispanic and non-hispanic white students, presented monday to the national association of secondary school principals, also found that scores of both groups increased with the size of schools they attended
george a. chambers, professor of educational administration at the university of iowa, and researcher phyllis s. peterson studied 1987 scores on the american college test, the predominant college admission test in 28 states
the purpose of the study was to compare how hispanic students and caucasian students score when the two groups are similarly situated,'' chambers said
students in the study were from arizona, california, colorado, florida, illinois, kansas, louisiana, nevada, new mexico, oklahoma, texas and utah
the students were divided equally among two groups identified as caucasian and hispanic, which included two subdivisions of mexican-americans and puerto ricans, cubans and others
the study created 964 pairs of one hispanic and one non-hispanic white student matched on the basis of 13 common attributes: high school, family income range, mathematics courses (algebra 1, algebra 2, geometry, trigonometry, calculus), science courses (general science, biology, chemistry, physics), gender and number of siblings
according to the study, the u.s. average composite act score is 15.2 for mexican-americans, 16.6 for the puerto-rican-cuban group, and 19.6 for non-hispanic whites. the act is scored on a scale of one to 36 and is taken annually by more than 1 million students
when matched, or ``similarly situated,'' the non-hispanics had a mean score of 18.7 compared with 16.7 for the mexican-american group, a difference of just two points instead of the national difference of 4.4 points
the non-hispanics scored 19.8 and puerto rican-cuban students scored 18.9 when similarly situated, a difference in composite score points of just 0.9 rather than the three points in the u.s. average
in addition, chambers said, the statistical analysis found that course work is more important than the level of income in determining scores
he said, however, that the higher the income level, the greater the tendency for a student to take advanced courses. that is probably because of factors such as the expectations of parents who have college educations, he said
it's not income necessarily in and of itself that makes the difference. rather, it's the things that result from income,'' chambers said
so we need to find a way to raise the expectations. we must overcome this force of income.''
the study also found that when schools were grouped into five categories according to the size of the graduating class, ranging from less than 200 to 900 or more, hispanic and non-hispanic scores went up with size, possibly because the larger schools have an expanded curriculum. each recorded an overall gain of two points
while many believe big is bad, if you look at the data here, it suggests big is better,'' chambers said
the principals' association, which was meeting here this week, represents 38,000 educators in middle, junior high and high schools nationwide. ^washington wire: gop vents fury on order to arrest absent senators</note>
fuming and sputtering, the senate is writing a new chapter in the long and tumultuous history of the legislative filibuster
actually the chapter is written, but the fuming and sputtering about it continue unabated
the other side needs to vent itself from time to time, and this is one of those occasions,'' said sen. alan simpson, r-wyo., the senate's acting minority leader, as senate republicans engaged in four hours of complaint about it last week
crybaby stuff!'' exclaimed senate majority leader robert c. byrd, d-w.va., who initiated the order to the senate sergeant-at-arms to compel the attendance of absent senators
the facts:
on feb. 23, after midnight, as the senate was deep into an old-fashioned, all-night, republican-led filibuster against a congressional campaign financing bill sought by majority democrats, an arrest warrant was issued for gop senators whose flight from the senate chamber prevented the quorum needed to do business
such a warrant was issued on sen. bob packwood, r-ore., who had locked himself in his senate office. packwood was carried onto the senate floor, feet first, and the quorum was established
keystone cops,'' republican senators cried
a low comedy about a legislature in a banana republic,'' steamed new york republican sen. alfonse d'amato
i am afraid we are playing a giant game of `gotcha,' to see who can get the other side,'' said sen. daniel evans, r-wash
under this arrest warrant for senators does the sergeant-at-arms have the right to enter my home?'' evans asked. ``does he have the right to seize me from my bed, for heavens' sake, in order to return me to the senate floor?''
the rules permit us to delay things for endless periods of time and to stay here all night and to arrest each other, and if all we do is to exhaust what is permitted under the rules then we create real havoc,'' said sen. john c. danforth, r-mo
why should a u.s. senator be arrested for less cause than a common criminal?'' asked sen. arlen specter, r-pa
hold on, said sen. george mitchell, d-maine, a former federal judge. the warrant was issued only to compel packwood's attendance on the senate floor, ``that is, do that which the senator was elected to do.''
there was nothing criminal about it, mitchell said
the rule in question is based on the provision in the constitution establishing a simple majority of the house and the senate as the number needed to establish a quorum to do business and authorizing a smaller number ``to compel the presence of absent members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each house may provide.''
each house has so provided, and when virtually all republican senators disappeared, the sergeant-at-arms was authorized to compel their presence. hence the packwood arrest
led by specter, several republican senators demanded the rules be changed to bar the arrest of senators between the hours of 11 p.m. and 8 a.m., among other things
byrd said that would ``cement in stone the ability of senators to stop any action simply by hiding in their offices.''
the senate arrest was not a game,'' byrd said. ``it was not a laughing matter
imagine senators, who are supposed to be grown-up people, adults, elected by the people to serve here _ and most senators would have given their right arm to serve here _ imagine seeing them run down the hall, run when they see the sergeant-at-arms. they made a calculated decision to run and hide, barricade their offices, put chairs against the doors.''
now they want to cry about it,'' byrd said. ``it was not the arrest that caused us to look bad. it was the spectacle of senators running to avoid coming to the senate floor. ... we are not elected to play games like children.''
the complaints and the counter complaints rolled on and finally there was a final complaint
the arrest warrants that were written but not served had been destroyed
many republican members said they wanted copies as mementos
never in my 63 years have i had an arrest warrant issued,'' evans told the senate
because it was unique i asked if i could have a copy so that i could put it in my scrapbook and have it available to show my children and my grandchildren,'' he said
now i find they are, somehow, not available.'' destroy it</head>
a woman who built an 80-ton wooden ark from salvaged timber is dismantling part of the vessel in an effort to beat a court deadline ordering it off a church's property
but kea tawana, who calls the ark her ``life's sweat and blood,'' says she needs more time to move the 86-foot-long craft, which has been termed a work of art by the american museum of folk art but an eyesore by the city
it's consumed 20 years of my life. short of a miracle ... the ark is doomed,'' tawana said
tawana had been working under a march 31 court deadline to move the ark from the parking lot of the humanity baptist church to newark bay, three-quarters of a mile away. superior court judge harry a. margolis recently extended the deadline until april 15
but tawana, who says she built the ark from oak, hemlock and pine to live in, not for religious reasons, says she needs more time to dismantle part of it for the move and obtain coast guard approval of the ship's seaworthiness
bad weather this winter prevented work on the ship from continuing,'' tawana said, adding that she will ask margolis at a march 22 hearing for a 90-day extension. ``april 15 does not give me enough time to render the ship floatable.''
tawana said she plans to sail the ark to the great lakes region and live there, although she did not say where
newark officials have long wanted the ark torn down. the city went to court over the issue, saying it was an eyesore and health hazard and violated zoning laws
however, margolis last spring prohibited the city from destroying it after the american museum of folk art in new york city wrote to mayor sharpe james and gov. thomas h. kean, urging them to preserve the structure
the ark is a very important and very rare example of urban folk art expression,'' said didi barrett, the museum's director of publications
the humanity baptist church had allowed tawana to live on the property as a caretaker in a ramshackle house next to the ark until last year, when it ended the relationship, saying that the court battle over the ark cost too much
the city wants to drive me out and turn this over to developers for condominiums,'' tawana said
but audrey davidson, assistant corporate counsel for newark, said zoning laws are the issue
i have no idea whether the city is trying to build something there. all i know is that the structure there is illegal,'' ms. davidson said
tawana said she will cut 4 feet off beams in the ark to reduce the vessel's height to 17 feet from 21 feet so it will not get snagged on cables running over streets on the trip to newark bay
the governing party rammed an election law that limits campaigning through the legislature today over the objection of opposition lawmakers who seized the podium and started a scuffle
leaders of the governing democratic justice party, protected by guards, ended hours of furious arguments and scuffling by suddenly calling for a vote and declaring the bill passed before the opposition could react
the governing party, which has a strong majority in the national assembly, passed the bill by a voice vote in a few seconds
opposition lawmakers rushed to the podium to try to drag down vice speaker chang sung-man and halt the vote but were blocked by assembly guards
outraged opposition representatives screamed insults at democratic justice party leaders after they were caught by surprise
the new law revises the assembly's constituency system to one lawmaker per district instead of two and clears the way for elections expected to be held in late april. the number of seats will increase from 276 to 299
the new law also limits the number of campaign rallies in any district to three joint meetings including all candidates. it bans any rallies by individual parties, prohibits street campaigning with loudspeakers and excludes appearances by national political leaders
opposition leaders said they would fight to overturn the sections of the law that limit campaigning, but it was unclear how they could succeed
opposition lawmakers occupied the podium for almost three hours to prevent passage of the bill after dragging the vice speaker from his chair and scuffling with government legislators
the government broke the deadlock when chang surrounded by guards suddenly took to the podium, called for a voice vote and passed the bill
kim tae-ryong, spokesman of the opposition reunification democratic party, said the government's actions proved it did not support democracy
the bill contains various malicious clauses designed to steal votes,'' he said after the bill was passed
the government, which had favored retention of the existing two member system, changed its position after the opposition repeatedly blocked attempts in the assembly to pass a new election law. the law had to be passed to hold elections scheduled to be held by april
opposition leaders said the bill would place excessive restrictions on campaigning
the opposition also wanted open counting of absentee ballots, charging that the government has used absentee ballots in the past to rig elections
the dispute, which lasted for almost two months, reflected the opposition's refusal to work with the government and deep divisions between the two sides
opposition leaders continue to insist that president roh tae-woo and the governing party won presidential elections in december through massive fraud. some top opposition leaders have refused to recognize roh's election
roh won with less than 50 percent of the vote because two opposition leaders split the opposition vote
the new law is expected to diminish the government's electoral chances in urban areas where it lacks sufficient strength to win majorities. the governing party had counted on coming in second in urban areas in the past to gain seats
but the governing party is also expected to gain in rural areas under the new system since it is strongest in the countryside. roh has promised broad democratic reforms to end decades of authoritarian rule and has said that elections will be fair and democratic
the bill increases the number of electoral districts from 184 to 224 and provides for one lawmaker per district
the existing system, whereby the winning party gets two-thirds of 92 bonus seats, also was changed so that it gets half of 75 bonus seats with the rest being divided among other parties on the basis of votes
the bonus system is designed to avoid deadlock in the assembly by giving the main party a clear majority
the new york post has officially become the property of real estate developer peter kalikow, who paid $37.6 million for the tabloid that has been losing money and circulation for years
it is my intention to stop the financial losses of the new york post,'' kalikow said monday in a statement after the papers transferring ownership were signed. ``the paper will be a winner financially and editorially.''
kalikow acquired the post after the paper's 10 unions agreed to a $22 million in concessions, which included a last-minute $3 million gift from then-owner rupert murdoch
the rescue of the post is nothing less than an historic moment,'' kalikow said
there was not one person involved in negotiations that did not go the extra mile in an effort to keep this great new york institution from disappearing. i want to thank all of our unions and employees for their heroic efforts.''
union leaders were to sign formal papers today and planned to meet with kalikow on thursday to ``get to know each other,'' said george mcdonald, president of the allied printing trades council, which represents eight of the unions
we're delighted, really delighted, glad it's all over.''
murdoch, who sold the paper to comply with federal regulations barring ownership of two media outlets in one city, claimed he was losing $100,000 a day on the post and lost $150 million in the 12 years he owned it
kalikow has pledged $2 million to promote the newspaper
i am committed to expanding its readership base through millions of dollars in promotion, adding features to the paper, greatly expanding its investigative reporting and strengthening its advertising revenues to make the paper profitable on a long-term basis.''
under murdoch, whom kalikow called ``one of the great contemporary publishers,'' the tabloid had a reputation for sensational coverage, with blaring headlines and plenty of gossip
new publisher peter price said ``my role is to make it work
i think peter kalikow has made an enormous financial commitment and it's my challenge and opportunity to put the pieces together and make a real business out of the post and not just a good newspaper,'' price said
spokesman howard rubenstein declined to say what specific changes kalikow and price would make in the appearance and content of the post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper, founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton
price, however, noted that ``the big difference between what we are able to do versus what others before us have tried to do is that peter kalikow and i share a sense of the city
we are both single-minded about the new york post. we are both single-minded about making this paper a permanent fixture in the new york city scene.''
hasan ahmed sat near a pile of rust-colored bricks, using a small bar of metal to pound the bricks into gravel
it was election day, declared a national holiday by the government and a nationwide general strike by the political opposition
sixty-year-old ahmed knew nothing about the holiday or strike, but he knew he needed his 50 cents in daily earnings
the turmoil of the parliamentary elections last week, in which 13 people died in clashes, passed by ahmed who still has four children at home. but he and the more than 80 million other bangladeshis who live below the poverty line still are caught up in its results
the election made no immediate headway in ending the stalemate between president hussain muhammad ershad and major opposition parties demanding his ouster
ershad, whose jatiya party won a predictable parliamentary majority, refuses to resign. the opposition vows to keep up its nearly four-month campaign of general strikes that is eroding the already weak economy
economic growth was an expected 5 percent this year, but the strikes and severe floods last summer have reduced the projection to 2 percent
we are in very bad shape,'' said a.s. mahmud, president of the dhaka chamber of commerce and industry. ``the politicians, they don't think of or try to understand the impact on the economy.''
mahmud said the 25 days of general strikes called since november last year were deeply affecting the country's new garment industry and could scare off foreign investment
the country of 105 million people has an estimated 30 percent unemployment and under-employment. more than 80 percent of the people live below the poverty line, defined by the world health organization as not earning enough for a diet of 1,800 calories daily. about 80 percent also are illiterate
while mahmud talked in terms of long-range economic consequences, abdul ghafoor saw more immediate effects of the political turmoil. it means trouble in feeding his family
ghafoor, 45, drives a bicycle rickshaw and has a wife and six children. he averages about $1.65 in earnings daily and says he does not work on a strike day for fear of being attacked by workers for opposition parties
we have no savings. we suffer that day,'' he said
ghafoor said he saw little hope that the election, which ershad called in a move to compromise with the opposition, would lead to such a compromise
how can i think that any of these people care about us?'' he asked. ``no leader has done anything for the poor.''
politicians and diplomats, who talked about the election results on the basis of anonymity, had more sophisticated judgments on the likelihood of a compromise. but they also expressed doubts one could be achieved
ershad, a former general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1982, still has strong backing from the army, meaning another coup soon seems unlikely. in bangladesh, a military takeover is always a possibility since every change in government in the country's 17 years of independence has been achieved by coup
the opposition, which claims ershad's 1986 election as president resulted from vote rigging, has failed to unseat the 58-year-old ershad despite the violent general strikes that led to at least 25 deaths
stepping up the violence could prompt ershad to reimpose the martial law in effect from 1982 to 1986 or could anger the public by devastating the economy
westerners in lhasa today said security forces had withdrawn from around the tibetan capital's main temple, where monks led a violent weekend protest that beijing said left hundreds of police injured
in the fullest official account yet of the rioting against chinese rule, the chinese news service today said more than 300 police were injured in the rioting saturday and sunday in lhasa. previous official reports had said that one policeman was killed and 28 injured in a single day of rioting
the fighting occurred in lhasa at the jokhang, tibet's holiest temple
one westerner in lhasa, a tibetan-speaking traveler, said tibetans told him five tibetans and three chinese police were killed in daylong violence saturday, the last day of a major prayer festival
another traveler, who arrived today chengdu, 750 miles east of lhasa, said officials told him two people were killed _ a chinese policeman who was pushed off a roof and a tibetan. both travelers spoke on condition of anonymity
the china news service said 30 police officers were hospitalized with serious injuries and ``numerous'' civilians were hurt in the violence _ the second nationalist riots in lhasa since october
in an eyewitness report seen in hong kong, the agency claimed the disturbances were plotted by unidentified tibetans who had bags of rocks placed on top of buildings around the central barkhor marketplace. it said buddhist monks on saturday poisoned tea given to officials and journalists, who had to be hospitalized. the report did not elaborate on their condition
during the rioting, local government and communist party officials were forced to slide down ropes from a second-story office in the jokhang to escape enraged monks, said the account by reporter geng jun. he said the officials slid to safety just before the monks broke down the office door
the report said ``some rioters set up barricades in barkhor marketplace on sunday morning and indiscriminately threw stones that injured numerous city residents.''
one monk stood up and started shouting for independence and he was arrested,'' the western traveler in lhasa said by telephone. ``the monks started throwing stones. the crowd just ran.''
he said authorities hustled him and other foreigners to their hotels. but when he left his room a few hours later to get food, he encountered a clash in the square in front of the johkang
i found myself in the middle of a skirmish. some tear gas went off near me. twenty to 30 tibetans were throwing stones at chinese soliders and the chinese soldiers were throwing stones back.''
the traveler said the chinese did not open fire. ``in that sense, the chinese were showing a lot of restraint.''
there have been no official figures given on arrests, but unconfirmed reports have said hundreds were rounded up
westerners in lhasa said johkang remained closed today but police on monday stopped blocking entry to the barkhor market square. they said uniformed police had been replaced by dozens of plainclothes officers who closely followed the few foreign tourists in town and would not allow them to take pictures
william tang, assistant foreign manager at the lhasa hotel, said guests were being told they could go to the square but ``at their own risk.''
the violence was the first in lhasa since oct. 1, when 2,000 tibetans led by monks burned down a police station facing jokhang temple. police opened fire, and at least 14 people were killed in the battle
the dalai lama, tibet's exiled spiritual leader china blames for instigating the riots, issued a statement from his office in new delhi on monday saying ``the courage of the tibetan people in expressing, once again, their dissatisfaction against chinese rule in spite of the obvious risk involved clearly reveal their desperation.''
the dalai lama, who fled following a failed uprising in 1959, also called on tibetans to ``restrain from violence.''
china says tibet has been part of the nation for centuries, and claims it is making amends for past polices that suppressed tibetan customs and religion and destroyed many of their temples
antagonisms remain strong, however, between the tibetans and the hans, china's ethnic majority who hold most of the top government posts in lhasa
the western traveler said tibetans told him police beat two monks to death inside the jokhang. several tibetans later carried the monks' bodies around the square, he said, triggering further clashes
television and movie producers scrambled to hire replacement scriptwriters and urged strikers to cross picket lines today in an effort to keep hollywood game shows and soap operas on the air
but the scriptwriters vowed to wait out the struggle as nearly 2,000 of them marched five abreast in front of 20th century fox studios monday, the first day of a walkout over demands for higher fees and more creative control
hollywood has treated writers like bean-field workers for years,'' said screenwriter and science-fiction author harlan ellison. ``it begins with the dream. without the dream on paper there is nothing.''
the writers guild of america rejected sunday's final offer by the alliance of motion picture and television producers and a strike was ordered for 9,000 members
the wga strike is the fourth since a 17-week walkout in 1973. the longest, in 1981, lasted three months
nick counter, the alliance's president and chief negotiator, predicted the walkout may be a long one. ``it's the same kind of feeling as we had in 1981,'' he said. ``this could go on even longer than that.''
issues include demands by writers for a higher percentage of foreign market distribution fees and more control over scripts, and a producers' demand to scale back syndication fees for one-hour television shows. producers say new shows made for independent stations have dried up the rerun syndication market
for some pickets like james l. brooks, whose writing credits include the films ``broadcast news'' and ``terms of endearment'' and television's ``the mary tyler moore show,'' a key battle was for creative control
if you take creative rights from enough different groups, you end up without a creation, you end up with something else. you end up with an exercise in marketing,'' brooks said
counter said producers may begin hiring temporary replacements for striking writers until a settlement is reached
our companies are encouraging whoever wants to come forward to write these scripts,'' he said, urging union and non-union writers to cross picket lines
counter said non-guild writers were being sought to avoid having soap operas and game shows go to reruns. the union said talk shows also would be among the first to suffer from the walkout
however, spokespersons for cbs and nbc said soap operas such as ``days of our lives,'' ``as the world turns,'' and ``the young and the restless'' shouldn't be affected soon because of stockpiled scripts
it's business as usual. we're prepared,'' cbs spokeswoman janet storm said
nbc's ``late night with david letterman'' and ``saturday night live,'' already were on scheduled breaks this week. ``the tonight show with johnny carson'' on monday featured guest host jay leno, who used material prepared before the strike
the guild's contract expired feb. 29. the median annual income for writers is $40,000, but about half of the wga's members are unemployed at any given time
israelis who spent nearly an hour on a bus with three armed guerrillas said they tried to stay calm, even offering one captor some milk, but finally became convinced ``we're not getting out of this alive.''
one wrote a final note to her three children. another laid down and thought: ``that's it, goodbye.''
three israelis _ two women and a man _ were killed monday during the incident in southern israel along with the three plo guerrillas
the bus' other eight passengers, workers on the way to their jobs at the dimona nuclear plant, were all injured during the ordeal
the palestine liberation organization claimed responsibility for the attack. the army said the guerrillas infiltrated from egypt
while israeli officials were negotiating with the three guerrillas to try to end the standoff, ``we tried to create a calm atmosphere,'' stella bechar, 46, who was hospitalized with multiple shrapnel and gunshot wounds, told the daily jerusalem post. ``each one had a gun, a kalashnikov, ready to shoot.''
some of the israelis aboard the bus spoke some arabic
i asked one (of the guerrillas) if he wanted some milk because he said he was thirsty,'' mrs. bechar said. ``we even tried to joke with each other, and we told each other that there is a god and we would get out of this alive.''
as negotiations continued, said fellow hostage daisy sorek, ``the terrorists were getting more and more impatient'' and threatened to kill a hostage every half hour if a red cross negotiator was not summoned
at one point he (one of the guerrillas) got a megaphone and became very, very agitated. he said, over and over in arabic, ``every half-hour, one,'' mrs. sorek said
the leader of the gang then called one passenger, victor ram, and ordered him to stand at the front of the bus, sorek told the post
then they shot him in the chest and he just fell, immediately. and then we knew: we're not getting out of this alive,'' she said. ``they seemed very confused. after they shot ram, the commander's gun didn't work anymore. something was wrong with it.''
i told them `it's such a shame, you're so young. you don't have to do this,''' rachel matza, who was recovering from surgery to remove shrapnel, told the post. ``but they said `no, we're going to die and we're going to blow you up with us.' ... we felt we were dead women.''
mrs. bechar remembers little of the rescue operation except laying down next to a pile of purses that the guerrillas had searched through
i remembered that on television they always say it's a good idea to lie down,'' she said. ``then i closed my eyes and i remember thinking, `that's it, goodbye.'''
mrs. sorek said while she was held on the bus she wrote a note to her three children. ``i wrote to them to ask the government to speed matters along between jews and arabs, to do something,'' she said
only with a peace agreement are we going to get anywhere.''

imagine senators, who are supposed to be grown-up people, adults, elected by the people to serve here _ and most senators would have given their right arm to serve here _ imagine seeing them run down the hall, run when they see the sergeant-at-arms.'' _ senate majority leader robert c. byrd, d-w.va., defending his decision to order the arrests of republican senators who left the chamber to prevent a quorum

specially trained u.s. drug agents are venturing into the bolivian jungle with local forces in a program that targets drug trafficking and may soon be expanded to other countries, a federal official said
the program, which began last year, is reportedly the first putting u.s. drug enforcement administration agents alongside local forces in south american countryside. the agents work in an advisory capacity, the san diego union reported today
the assistance was requested by bolivia and will be expanded into five other south american countries that have also requested the service, dea chief john lawn told the newspaper. he refused to identify the other countries
this is a significant step for dea because we have countries seeking the kind of assistance that we want to provide,'' lawn said. ``we believe this operation will have an impact in the u.s. and european cocaine market.''
u.s. drug agents previously have concentrated their anti-drug efforts in the region's urban areas, but agents sometimes worked in undercover at a host country's request, lawn said
under the program, volunteer u.s. drug agents undergo a three-month training program that includes a weapons course at the marine training base at quantico, va., a language program, and a jungle survival school led by the u.s. army special forces in panama, he said
the first graduates were sent to bolivia last fall
some u.s. agents trained in the program were involved in the tracking down of two major bolivian cocaine labs two months ago, lawn said. twelve suspects were indicted on drug trafficking conspiracy charges as a result of that investigation
in addition, bolivian pilots are using u.s. helicopters to find and disrupt the drying of coca leaves
mercedes-benz of north america has announced its fourth price increase since march 1987 because of the continuing weakness of the dollar against the west german mark
mercedes said monday prices on nine of its 13 models will increase an average 1.6 percent on cars delivered to dealers starting april 18
the three least expensive mercedes models, the 190es, will not be affected by the increases, which will boost the price of the next model, the 260 e sedan, to $37,845 from $37,250
at the other extreme, the price of 560sec will jump to $77,065 from $75,850, said mercedes spokesman a.b. shuman
iran and iraq today fired more missiles at each other's capitals, and iran accused the united states and france of helping iraq refit soviet-designed missiles to give them enough range to hit tehran
the charge was made by iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani
before the latest round of the so-called ``war of the cities'' began feb. 29, iraq had been unable to hit tehran with surface-to-surface missiles because the city is nearly 300 miles from the iraqi border
iran's official islamic republic news agency reported that an iraqi missile crashed into a residential neighborhood of tehran early today, killing or wounding ``several'' civilians and damaging a church
state-run baghdad radio reported that iraqi gunners fired the missile into tehran, a city of 6 million people, less than an hour after iran claimed it had lobbed a projectile into baghdad
iraq's news agency confirmed the latest iranian missile strike on a residential area in baghdad, saying civilians, including women, children and eldery people, were killed. no figures were given
irna also said revolutionary guards today shot a missile at a ``military center'' at amarah, an iraqi town close to the border and halfway between baghdad and the southern port city of basra
iraqi statements made no mention of the amarah strike
the reports were monitored in nicosia
iraq said it fired three missiles into tehran on monday, and iran reported its revolutionary guards blasted baghdad with four missiles and launched a fifth at the northern city of mosul for the first time
iraq confirmed only two missiles crashed monday in baghdad, a city of 5 million, killing or wounding ``many civilians, including women and children.''
iraq says it has fired 42 projectiles into tehran since the missile duel began when iran sent two missiles crashing into baghdad in retaliation for an earlier iraqi air raid on the tehran oil refinery
iraq also has fired three missiles at the holy city of qom, seat of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini's religious hierarchy
the iranians have reported more than 30 missiles have hit tehran. they said revolutionary guards fired 25 long-range missiles on iraq during that period, 23 of them on baghdad. the iraqis have only acknowledged 19 hits on the capital and one on mosul
both sides reported air raids on each other's cities and artillery bombardment of border towns on monday
irna said 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 people wounded in monday's iraqi missile attacks on tehran's residential areas. it reported one missile demolished a clinic, a school and several houses
iran has listed at least 122 civilians killed and more than 300 wounded in the iraqi missile blitz, with more than 100 killed and more than 500 wounded in air raids over the last week. the iraqis have reported heavy civilian casualties, but gave no exact figures
rafsanjani, khomeini's representative on the supreme defense council which directs war policy, said iranian experts who examined several unexploded missiles confirmed the projectiles were soviet scud-bs, tehran radio reported
it became clear that although the missile is made in russia, most of the eastern (bloc) countries manufacture or assemble this missile today, and iraq can obtain it from other sources,'' he said in an interview on the radio
iran last week accused moscow of supplying iraq with the missiles, triggering several violent protests outside the soviet embassy in tehran and the consulate-general in the central city of isfahan. the soviet union who, along with france, is main arms supplier of iraq, denied the charge
iraq said the missile used, named ``al hussein'' after a 7th century shiite moslem saint, was of its own design and production
however, western military analysts believe the missiles were scud-bs, fitted with the help of north korean experts with strap-on boosters to give the projectile enough range to reach tehran
but rafsanjani said the missiles fired at tehran were scud-bs that ``have been clumsily tampered with'' in order to increase their range. the scud normally has a range of 190 miles
of course, not the iraqis themselves, for the iraqis are incapable of even tampering with these missiles. no doubt, the major powers did this. such powers as the americans and france,'' he said
investigators searching for the cattle rustlers who stole 25 cows from a western illinois farm know they aren't dealing with amateurs
of the 80 cows at two rivers farm, the thieves took only the ones that were pregnant
all had been bred and were ready to calve, some of them within 24 hours,'' state police sgt. mike ernst said monday
it would have had to have been somebody familiar with cattle.''
the cows were stolen late saturday or early sunday from a holding barn 2 miles north of kingston, ernst said
it's in a pretty secluded area,'' he said. ``there's no house and no house in sight. the nearest house is a half mile away.''
the mixed-breed cows, which two rivers was feeding and housing for their owners, are more valuable because they are pregnant, ernst said
a calf would be worth at least $150 by itself,'' he said
investigators have few leads, ernst said. there are indications that a truck was used to haul the cows away, police said
the thieves also took a motorcycle, a welder, a saddle, tools and several bags of orchard grass and clover seed, police said. the loss of the animals and equipment was valued at $30,000, ernst said. ^by michael west</byline>
panamanian embassy workers and private security men used a land rover to smash into and seize the panamanian consulate, whose top diplomat had remained loyal to deposed president eric arturo delvalle
police said they believed the six assailants, including two representatives of panamanian ambassador guillermo vega, entered the building monday night after using the jeep to break through its reinforced plate glass door
the consul, eduardo arango, had refused to give up his post despite being fired for still recognizing delvalle
the british broadcasting corp. said the consulate staff had also remained loyal to delvalle, who was ousted feb. 26 after trying to dismiss gen. manuel antonio noriega, panama's military leader and de facto ruler
control of panama's embassy in washington is also in dispute
the reagan administration has been trying to force noriega to step down since the general was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in florida last month
the land rover, driven by one of the british security men, mounted the sidewalk, smashed through the door into the lobby of the consulate, which is about a mile from the panamanian embassy
shortly after this several people left the building, including three women believed to be secretaries, and a number of security staff. one glass-paneled front door was damaged. no one was injured,'' police said in a statement
arango was at his london home at the time and was told about it by one of the consulate staff
one consular official who was forced out, tourism commissioner rolando domingo, 24, said: ``we were just working in there and then suddenly we heard a crash.'' he said the jeep came through the glass door and then a group of men entered the building carrying large hammers
they threatened us with hammers and one tried to hit my face. they took my passport and documents. then they pushed me down the stairs and out of the building,'' domingo said
police sealed off the area around the consulate in tudor street in the city, london's financial district
police said they entered the consulate after negotiations with panamanian government representatives they did not identify, and left the building in the control of the ambassador and his security staff
arango, in a bbc interview, condemned the forced entry as ``a thuggish way of behaving and an unbelievable way of doing things in a civilized country.''
he was quoted by the british domestic news agency press association as saying he was prevented from entering the consulate after the seizure and that one of the men involved told him they were working for vega and carrying out orders from panama
the agency also quoted arango as saying he had received letters from panama saying he was dismissed but ignored them. british government officials said they were told on friday that arango was being fired as consul
the bbc said arango was in panama at the time of delvalle's ouster and has said he helped smuggle delvalle from his residence to a hiding place in the central american country
arango said he would protest to the british foreign office and said the british driver of the land rover ought to be prosecuted
the security guards involved work for gb security, a private company based at sutton in south london
a spokesman at the british foreign office, who in accordance with british practice declined to be named, said it was too early to say what action, if any, foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe might take over the incident
poufs, ruffles, frills and furbelows are banished from the fashion scene, say the cream of italy's designers showing their fall-winter collections in milan
coming on strong is a cool, calm and collected look that is both elongated and elegant. pants play a major role in preference to last season's mini skirts
the new, haughty look is one which is right up gianfranco ferre's alley. he has always designed with a high-stepping female in mind rather than a romantic heroine
in his show monday, the dramatic shirts that are his signature had important, stiffly up-standing collars that jutted forward into crumb-catcher folds
actress ali mcgraw, who was a guest at the show, said: ``i love them.''
slim pants in smooth wools or crushed velvet provided the perfect accompaniment to these important shirts
ferre's color choice, in scarlet, black and white, was as forceful as his fashion statement. he even dyed beaver fur scarlet for blouses and detachable cuff collars that trimmed coats and jackets
but one red touch he could have done without was the scarlet eyeshadow daubed on the models' eyelids
big winter coats were cut slim and straight and almost brushed the ankles. jackets that were neat and short and minus collars were wrapped up in matching wool stoles
and he had lots of little foxes running down the runway in a variety of guises, spiralling round sleeves, forming skirts and curling round necks and hemlines
evenings were largely based on black, looking good on long-length smartly tailored redingotes that flared into fullness from a lowered waistline. white lace kerchiefs _ another mcgraw favorite _ spilling from collars and cuffs gave a dandified look
earlier on monday, leather fashions specialist, mario valentino, was another pants fan but with a difference. he cut them newly wide-legged and floppy, stemming from a high waistline, in supple suede
accompanying jackets were also loose and boxy. he took the padding out of shoulders on a handsome coat in calf that flared out to its near floor-length hemline
and he struck a blow for the return to the straight and narrow with his super-slender suit comprising a trim little jacket and pencil-slim, calf-length skirt in glossy leather. aviators' jackets and top coats in dark chocolatae brown were treated to fur linings
with ferre and versace now both creating couture fashions in addition to their lines of deluxe ready-made styles, there is news that the fashion house of andre laug, which showed in milan sunday, has also reversed its decision to no longer make clothes for private clients
this house, famed for its superb sartorial skills, suspended the custom-made side of the business for a brief period but now intends to reinstate it
couture provides a fashion house with allure and gives invaluable promotional power that can aid other activities belonging to the same establishment
milan shows swing into their third day today. highlights are to include the fabulous furs of the famed fendi family
everywhere evan l. mecham goes, people ask him about his political and legal problems. he tells them he has none
evan l. mecham is not the governor of arizona. he is not facing impeachment, a recall election or a trial in superior court
he lives in denver, owns a liquor distributorship, and in his travels around the country is constantly telling people, ``no, no, no, i'm not that evan mecham.''
when he first heard that arizona's mecham had been elected governor in november 1986, colorado's mecham said he was encouraged
well, you would hope some good would come of it,'' said mecham, 38. ``i'd hate to run for public office now. my political aspirations would have to be put on the back burner.''
to say that he takes the notoriety in stride is an understatement. a call to his home phone gets the recorded voice of his daughter, tiffany, 11
if you're trying to reach governor evan mecham, you have the wrong number,'' the recording says. ``however, if you have a campaign contribution of $300,000 or more and wish to keep it confidential, please leave your name and number and we'll get back to you. thank you for your support.''
playing in the background is the battle hymn of the republic
the demolition of the 16-story travelers insurance building provided some surprises for its downtown neighbors. one was a phenomenon little seen by city dwellers: sunlight
a restaurant manager directly across from the rubble-filled site in boston's financial district jokingly complained monday that light now beats through his floor-to-ceiling windows without the skyscraper to block it out
they should start issuing sunglasses to the employees,'' said manager frank strangie, manager of sandwich expressions
but others in the area weren't amused by the dusty windows, dirty floors and shattered glass resulting from sunday's demolition
there was a little bit more broken glass than we had expected,'' said bill ramsey of control demolitions inc., which conducted the blast that caused the building to implode, or collapse inward
up to two dozen windows at strangie's building were shattered, said its manager, david ham
the whole building is filthy, we have to have it washed down,'' strangie said
the demolition company has agreed to pay for the cost of replacing the panes but plans to look at clean-up costs on a case-by-case basis, ramsey said
the weather seemed springlike across much of the nation early today, with mild temperatures and rainshowers common
but on monday, a severe thunderstorm struck north-central texas, producing hail an inch in diameter in some places. lightning sparked numerous grass fires
milder, springlike thunderstorms developed across parts of northern texas and oklahoma, while showers extended across western missouri, western iowa, parts of kansas, northwest oklahoma, the texas panhandle, western louisiana and southeast texas. light rain covered much of southern minnesota, wisconsin and parts of lower michigan
rain mixed with sleet and wet snow fell in northern wisconsin, while snowfall in the northern plains diminished late monday. some light snow extended from western nebraska across parts of the dakotas to northern minnesota. an inch of wet snow was reported at duluth, minn., early today
windy conditions covered portions of the northern and central high plains. winds gusted to between 40 and 50 mph throughout monday evening and early today at rapid city, s.d
other than scattered light rain in western washington, the western third of the nation was dry, as was the east coast and much of the southeast
mild temperatures prevailed over much of the nation, and even the colder air in the rockies and northern plains lacked a wintry punch
the high for the nation monday was 88 at thermal, calif
the forecast for today called for showers and thunderstorms from southern and eastern texas across eastern oklahoma to the lower and middle mississippi valley; scattered showers from lower michigan to alabama late in the day; rain or snow from northeast new mexico and northwest texas to upper michigan, with snow likely over minnesota and the eastern dakotas; sunny skies over the atlantic coast states and west of the rockies, except for light rain spreading into western washington state; strong winds over south texas and the northern high plains
much the nation is expected to have highs in the 50s or 60s. highs will be in the 30s and 40s from the central rockies across the central and northern plains, from the upper mississippi valley to upper michigan, and from upstate new york to northern and central new england; 40s from northern new mexico to central oklahoma; and 70s and lower 80s in california, the desert southwest and from southern texas to the southern atlantic coast

the justice department has given permission to unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in the north carolina republican presidential primary, according to state gop chairman jack hawke
the last-minute ruling clears up confusion that arose last week when a department official said the state party had failed to obtain necessary clearance to open its primaries to independents
the department said its decision applied only to today's presidential primary and that the state republican party would have to submit another request for the policy to receive permanent approval
we have constantly tried to show that we're a party with an open door and want people to join us ... and this is just another step,'' hawke said at a news conference
hawke declined to predict how many unaffiliated voters would take advantage of the opportunity or which of the four republican presidential hopefuls stood to benefit most from the new policy
nearly half of washington state's voters would prefer to replace the state's existing caucus system with a presidential primary election, a poll says
the sample of 500 registered voters found 48 percent preferred a primary, 27 percent want to stick with the caucus system and 25 percent with no preference between the two options
the poll, conducted feb. 24-27 for the seattle times, had a margin of error of 5 percent
the preference for a primary election was stronger among democrats than republicans and stronger among men than women, the poll found
the caucus method is ``just a good-ol'-boy system,'' said oliver smith, 55, a renton elementary school teacher. ``i've had friends that have gone to the caucuses and they weren't given the time of day unless they were insiders.''
but barbara clark, a mental health therapist from bainbridge island, favored the caucuses
it gives people a chance to come out and debate things face to face,'' she said. ``that's more than you get in a primary.''
the idea of a presidential primary has been introduced repeatedly in the state legislature, with no success
massachusetts gov. michael dukakis planned to vote in a boston suburb today, after frenetic campaigning that included a super tuesday endorsement from south florida's elderly ``condo boss.''
dukakis was picked from among the democratic contenders who courted annie ackerman, a 74-year-old former chicago ward organizer who has a knack for getting out the vote among this area's vast retirement community
you have come out to listen to the man who will be the next president of the united states,'' mrs. ackerman told about 500 senior citizens at point east condominiums monday. she spoke of dukakis' immigrant roots, something he had in common with many of those at the rally
my mother would have said he's a mensch,'' mrs. ackerman said, referring to the yiddish word for good man. ``he's a person of integrity who gets things done.''
dukakis planned to vote this morning, spend a quiet day at his statehouse office and then fly to chicago to begin campaigning for the illinois primary
milan, italy _ a malfunctioning heater and a broken humidifier at a museum damaged about 20 renaissance paintings, including works by piero della francesca, italian media reported
the heater malfunction at the brera gallery allowed the temperatures in recent days to rise to 75 degrees, well above the normal 55-57 degrees, news agencies and newspapers reported over the weekend
the museum said in addition to works by della francesca were ``the redeemer'' by giovanni bellini, ``madonna with child'' by giulio campi and ``mother and child'' by carlo carra
brambilla barcilon, an art restorer, said the works on wood such as those by della francesca suffer from every minimal change in climatic conditions. the heat causes the paint to peel away from the wood in some places, he said
the winner of a $21 million ohio lottery prize said he doesn't feel any richer yet, and he hopes the money won't change his family life
richard couchot, 49, of ashland, ky., turned in his winning ticket for validation monday at the lottery's columbus office, lottery spokeswoman anne bloomberg said
she confirmed that couchet won wednesday's ``super lotto'' drawing and will receive $21 million in 20 annual payments of $1.05 million, or $840,000 after federal withholding tax
i hope that we use the money wisely and that it doesn't change our friends and our children,'' couchot said in a telephone interview late monday before flying here for a news conference
money shouldn't change your life,'' he said. ``we're very rich right now. it's been tough putting three kids through college and we've got one more to go.''
he said he was calm after learning that he won the lottery prize
i don't have any more today than yesterday,'' he said. ``the reaction may come after you receive the money.''
his wife, katharine, said: ``it's hard to believe. for five days i've been weak and trembling. i can hardly believe it.''
mrs. couchot, 48, said her husband is vice president of ashland financial services and plans to continue working at least until a replacement is found
mrs. couchot said she and her husband grew up in piqua, near dayton, ohio, but have lived in ashland, just across the ohio river from southeastern ohio, for about 18 years
the couchots are the second biggest winners of the ohio lottery after an indiana couple who won $25 million with one ticket in april 1986. picks up 7th graf pvs, `elections are ...' deletes last three grafs.</note>
a newly united opposition called for the removal of gen. manuel antonio noriega and the formation of a transitional government, while pro-noriega diplomats seized panama's london consulate from rivals
the nation's banks were shuttered for a fifth day on monday. outside, retired people unable to cash pension checks blocked traffic and shouted ``where's my money!''
in another development, a u.s. judge extended a freeze on panamanian government funds in american banks
opposition organizations and ousted president eric arturo delvalle joined forces after 10 days of turmoil triggered by delvalle's attempt to fire noriega and the resulting dismissal of the president, who remains in hiding
virtually all the nation's civilian political forces not directly linked to the armed forces or to the noriega regime joined in the alliance
in london monday night, panamanian embassy workers and private security men used a land rover to smash into and seize the consulate, whose top diplomat had remained loyal to delvalle
police reported no injuries, though some consulate workers said they were threatened with hammers, and left the building in control of panamanian ambassador guillermo vega
consul eduardo arango acknowledged he had been fired for remaining loyal to delvalle, who the united states still considers panama's president
in a declaration issued in panama monday, the opposition alliance said ``our principal objective'' is ``the establishment of a government of national reconciliation that guarantees justice, a state of law, liberty, reconstruction of democratic institutions, fiscal order, economic development, conditions for authentic democracy and the celebration of free, open and honest elections.''
elections are scheduled for may 1989
among those signing the document were arnulfo arias of the panamanian authentic party, the country's largest opposition party. arias has been president three times and was ousted by the military each time. his supporters claimed he was robbed of victory in the 1984 election
also signing were representatives of the two other opposition parties and the national civic crusade, an alliance of 200 professional, business, labor and political organizations that has led anti-noriega protests since june
the declaration recognizes delvalle ``as he who now exercises the office of president.'' it praised his attempt to fire noriega feb. 25, saying he ``demonstrated he has committed himself to the changes necessary for establishment of a legitimate democracy.''
delvalle moved up from the vice presidency when the military pressured then-president nicolas ardito barletta, who was declared winner in the 1984 election, to resign in september 1985
the alliance said a national reconciliation government would include ``representatives of political parties and other forces dedicated to the reestablishment in panama of a democratic order.''
it said the government ``will pursue an understanding with the defense forces in order to define their legitimate function.''
with the declaration, delvalle and his vice president, roderick esquivel, who also was deposed, issued a statement calling for respect for individual rights, subordination of the military to civilian authority, the naming of a new cabinet, a new supreme court and new electoral magistrates
the reagan administration has called for noriega's ouster since he was indicted in florida in february on federal drug trafficking charges
in washington, white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on monday said the reagan administration was considering economic and trade sanctions against panama, including withholding monthly payments for the panama canal and putting the money into escrow
on march 15, the united states is due to pay $6.5 million to the panama canal commission, a monthly installment on the $75 million to $80 million washington provides panama each year under the canal treaty
the panama canal commission spokeswoman, willie friar, monday denied media reports that port authorities were requiring cash payments from ships traveling through the canal. she said the flow of traffic was ``completely normal.''
in new york, u.s. district judge lloyd f. macmahon on monday extended for 10 days a temporary restraining order issued thursday preventing two u.s. banks from transferring an estimated $50 million to the national bank of panama
panama uses the u.s. dollar for its currency and calls it the balboa. the government periodically receives tender from the u.s. banks where it keeps an estimated $50 million on deposit
a request for such a transfer last week was denied because of legal action, backed by washington, taken on behalf of delvalle
local banks in panama closed last week, fearing a run on deposits because of political instability. on friday, foreign banks also closed, and businesses stopped taking checks or credit cards
the government promised to set up payment centers for the country's 60,000 pensioners, but they were not in operation monday whem most picked social security checks for the first two weeks of march, ranging from $60 to $250
a fisherman died after a gar fish jumped out of the water and cut his neck, a newspaper reported today
the fish, a forktail alligator gar, struck fisherman anthony fernando, 21, monday night, the sun newspaper reported. he died before fellow fishermen could get him to a hospital, the paper said
the paper quoted his brother, nisantha, as saying the incident occurred off the southwestern coast of the island. he speculated that the fish, one of a number jumping in the water at the time, had been attracted by a light on their boat
a woman who ambushed and shot her former psychologist, his wife and young daughter after harassing them for years pleaded guilty to attempted murder and assault and faces a mandatory life prison term
kimberly a. gracyalny, 30, entered her plea monday before municipal court judge david m. horwitz
ms. gracyalny began harassing david fox, a neuro-psychology specialist, and his family soon after he treated her between november 1982 and march 1983 for an undisclosed problem, authorities said
on dec. 20, ms. gracyalny hid in the front yard of the family's suburban home and opened fire with a handgun as they returned from dinner, chasing them around the house to the back yard before the couple was able to subdue her
the attack left fox, 34, shot in the arm, his wife deborah, 31, shot in both legs, and their 6-year-old daughter shot in the left leg. three sons, ages 9, 10, and 18 months, were unharmed
under the terms of a plea bargain, ms. gracyalny pleaded guilty to one count of premeditated attempted murder, which carries the mandatory life term, and two counts of assault. five additional premeditated attempted murder counts are to be dropped at the april 5 sentencing
in 1986, the psychologist obtained a superior court restraining order against ms. gracyalny after she allegedly stalked the family, made threatening phone calls and trespassed on their property, sometimes shooting off flashbulbs in front of their windows
the dollar fell against nearly all major currencies in active european trading early today, partly depressed by a surge in the british pound, dealers said. gold bullion also fell
dealers said investors continued to focus on the pound, selling large amounts of dollars for pounds for a second straight day. they said it became clear monday that the bank of england had not intervened with substantial sales of pounds to rein in the currency
the pound was boosted by strong economic growth and relatively high interest rates in britain, dealers said. sterling rose to $1.8270 from $1.8135 late monday, more than 5 cents higher than monday's opening
in tokyo, where trading ends before it begins in europe, the dollar fell to a closing 127.80 japanese yen from 128.87 yen at monday's close. but later in london, the dollar edged back up to 128.35 yen

a bus plunged 260 feet into a ravine in central china, killing 39 people and injuring the other 17 on board, the official xinhua news agency reported
the chinese-built bus was making a turn at the bottom of a hill in henan province on monday when it swung off the road and fell, the agency said. the crash immediately killed 33 people and six others died later in the hospital, said the report, monitored in tokyo
all the survivors were injured, but the report did not say how seriously
police were investigating how the accident occurred, xinhua said
several bus and train accidents have been reported in china in recent weeks, with more than 100 people reported killed
the murder trial of a jobless handyman accused of killing seven women in his apartment and leaving their bodies to rot moved quickly into testimony after the defendant waived his right to a jury trial
the defense and prosecution also declined to give opening statements monday in the case of harrison ``marty'' graham
graham, 28, waived a trial by jury as a panel waited to be interviewed, then pleaded innocent to seven counts each of murder, involuntary manslaughter and abuse of a corpse
he and his mother agreed that a judge would be more objective than a jury,'' graham's attorney, joel moldovsky, said after the court session. the move is also expected to shorten a trial that had been expected to last up to three months
assistant district attorney roger king moved for admission of all testimony and documents from a monthlong pretrial suppression hearing, including a confession graham made to police in which he admitted strangling the seven women during sex. common pleas judge robert latrone granted the request
during the pretrial hearing, moldovsky, contending his client is mentally incompetent, sought unsuccessfully to suppress the confession
moldovsky said the confession was made in violation of his client's constitutional rights and after graham allegedly was beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation. latrone ruled last week the confession was voluntary and that graham was competent to stand trial
the first witness called by the prosecution, acting city medical examiner robert catherman, testified that all seven deaths were homicides. however, the cause of death, due to the condition of the bodies, was undetermined, he said
graham turned himself in a week after police discovered rotting bodies in his bedroom and leg and foot bones on the roof of the house in a philadelphia neighborhood notorious for drug dealing
in the confession graham told police the bodies began piling up in his bedroom, and he began having problems with maggots. he also told of difficulty sleeping during the day because of big black birds on the roof outside his apartment eating the woman's body there
i had to stay high all the time,'' the confession said
moldovsky has indicated that his defense will be insanity

the privately funded u.s. patent model foundation in washington began invent america a little more than a year ago as part of an effort to boost the share of inventions patented in this country by americans
the proportion of patents issued by the u.s. patent office to americans has dropped from 89 percent in 1966 to 53 percent in 1987. the remainder go to foreign-born inventors who want to protect their creations in this country
the invent america class is taught at dommerich one day a week to each of five classes of gifted students in different grades by gil rowe
he came here from ocoee elementary school, where he started the program and had great success. ocoee won four of invent america's nine state awards last year, the most of any school in the country
we've just kind of forgotten to teach the children the old american ingenuity,'' says rowe, 44
eleven-year-old seth is certain that the creativity class works
like when you grow up, if you become a scientist, you'll be a little bit better at it than someone who never had this before,'' he said
besides opening up the innovative process, rowe says, the program enhances students' self-esteem. one ocoee second-grader who was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented a device that earned him his classmates' admiration
suddenly he became a famous inventor. he just became a totally different individual,'' rowe said
only two orange county schools took part in the program last year, but two dozen are involved this year, as are others around the state
four million pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade participated nationwide in 1987 _ about 13 percent of all students in those grades, the foundation reported
other inventions have ranged from a self-cleaning bathtub to salt dyed red so that people can know how much they use
a judge froze the remainder of a half million dollars donated to save liver-transplant patient ronnie desillers after officials complained that his mother squandered money on a luxury waterfront apartment, clothes and jewelry
immediate and irreparable injury will result to assets of the estate of ronald desillers jr. if maria desillers is permitted to withdraw the funds deposited in the account,'' dade circuit judge francis j. christie wrote in his order monday
when ronnie died at children's hospital of pittsburgh last april 29 at age 7, an account in his name had accumulated $509,913, state officials said. the account balance on feb. 17 was $239,288, said fred kerstein, assistant dade county state attorney
our concern was that the remaining assets would be wasted,'' kerstein said. ``we wanted to safeguard those assets and let the court determine how they'll be distributed.''
as recently as jan. 19, $25,000 was withdrawn from the fund, said a court document filed by state attorney general bob butterworth and state attorney janet reno of miami
the state accusation said bank records indicated ms. desillers spent at least $47,000 on jewelry, clothing, furniture, housing expenses, an automobile and auto expenses
ronnie, who died last year while awaiting a fourth transplant, attracted donations from around the country, including $1,000 from president reagan, after news reports that money raised by his classmates had been stolen
ms. desillers, who created a foundation to assist other children in need of organ transplants after her son's death, denied squandering any of the donations
why do they not say that money went to charity?'' ms. desillers told the associated press on monday night. ``why do they not say that some of that money was assigned to me personally? ... how come they don't say how much of that money went to kids?''
she said she would straighten out the status of the frozen money in probate court and use the funds to provide organ transplants for two children
there are two children that have less than six months to live, and that's what i want to do with the money,'' she said
ms. desillers' lawyer, harry robbins, said his client maintains she never asked the public to donate money and thus was not legally a charity. she also has said she was entitled to the money as ronnie's sole heir
ms. desillers' finances came under question when it was learned she lived in a luxury apartment building on biscayne bay and was driving a 1985 bmw equipped with a telephone. she contends the car was second-hand and bought with a loan, that the car telephone was a gift and the apartment doubled as her office
ms. desillers is being sued by children's hospital for failing to pay $261,189 of ronnie's $424,302 bill. she has charged the hospital with giving poor care to her son. first sentence. picks up 2nd graf pvs ``foreign minister...''</head>
syria, the strongest critic of u.s. middle east policy, has found ``positive elements'' in american efforts to reactivate the stalled process but remains suspicious of the initiative's goals, sources say
syria's leaders are consulting with jordan and studying proposals handed last week to president hafez assad by secretary of state george p. shultz
foreign minister farouk al-sharaa is expected to fly to amman this week to discuss the plan after weekend contacts between assad and king hussein, said the knowledgeable syrian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity
but they question whether the united states is serious about finding a comprehensive settlement to the arab-israeli conflict or is simply trying to end palestinian rioting in israeli-occupied lands through promises of peace
like all arab governments, damascus supports the palestinian rebellion in the west bank and gaza strip, unprecedented in the 40-year-old conflict, that threatens washington's middle east ally with a prolonged civil war
more than 80 palestinians have been killed in the violence that has plagued the occupied territories since dec. 8 in what arabs hail as the ``intafada,'' or uprising. there have been no israel fatalities in the rioting
syria, moscow's main arab ally and a key player in the middle east, remains suspicious of attempts to isolate issues involved in the quest for a settlement into separate negotiations, a strategy it believes favors israel
syria believes it has a better chance of regaining the strategic golan heights, captured by israel in 1967, through a comprehensive settlement. unlike the other occupied territories, israel annexed the heights in 1981
charles snow, a veteran middle east analyst, wrote in the respected middle east economic survey: ``there is one major problem which clearly has the potential to derail the entire process _ the golan heights
syria has always been deeply suspicious that attempts to separate the issues in the arab-israeli conflict are merely camouflage for a partial settlement which will leave israel in ... possession of the golan.''
the u.s. plan would convene an international conference within a few weeks. by may 1, israel and a joint delegation of jordanians and palestinians would discuss limited self-rule for the 1.5 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza for an interim three-year period. later in the year, a wider international conference would bring in other parties to debate the ultimate future of the occupied arab land captured by israel in the 1967 war
a syrian source said the main question is how much pressure washington is prepared to exert on israel to accept a ``land for peace'' exchange
the arabs, including syria, spearhead of arab radicalism, have accepted this principle. but israeli hardliners reject withdrawal from lands it seized in 1967 and are at odds with moderates over the way to go. arabs fear the israeli impasse could block any progress
some syrian officials question the sincerity of an initiative launched by the reagan administration, which they say has done little to rein in israel
since reagan was elected in 1980, israel attacked iraq's nuclear plant in 1981, annexed the golan heights later that year, invaded lebanon in 1982, bombed the plo's headquarters in tunisia in 1984 and continued to build settlements in the occupied territories
israel also has defied a series of u.n. resolutions condemning its repeated air raids on palestinian bases in lebanon
furthermore, arab officials stress, the reagan adminstration has made no effort to pressure israel to honor commitments under the camp david accords which called for palestinian self-rule
the accords, signed by egypt and israel in 1978 under the sponsorship of former president carter, has been dormant since reagan took office
syria, like other arab governments, denounced the accord as violating arab summit resolutions that banned seperate peace treaties with israel outside a comprehensive settlement
but, with u.s. presidential elections only a few months away, the syrians are wondering what guarantees shultz can offer that any accord reached under reagan would be honored by israel after the change of adminstration
a commentary by state-run damascus radio said that although the exact details of the u.s. proposal have not been made public, arab leaders felt it was an american effort to monopolize the peace initiative, outside the framework of the united nations, and to keep out the soviet union
but the commentary, the first official reaction to shultz's plan, welcomed washington's renewed interest in resolving the conflict and its support for an international peace conference as a step in the right direction

mikhail gorbachev's chief economic adviser has cut short his visit to silicon valley because of his mother's death in the soviet union
abel aganbegyan had planned a three-day tour that included visits to sun microsystems and acuson, both in mountain view. sun microsystems makes desktop workstations while acuson produces medical imaging equipment
aganbegyan held a brief news conference at san francisco international airport on monday
american citizens know very little about joint ventures with the soviet union,'' he said
the soviet official said the united states is ``putting up obstacles in the way of technology transfers. other countries, such as japan, do not.''
aganbegyan is an architect of ''perestroika,'' gorbachev's wholesale restructuring of the stagnant economy
the visit to santa clara county was to have been the final part of an 18-day trip through six american cities to increase interest among u.s. companies in joint ventures with the soviets. light</head>
a man parachuted off a downtown building, landing on a car that was stopped at a red light, then jumped into another car and fled, police said today
officer thomas karczewski said police had no suspects but were checking a license plate number provided by musiliu alagbala, whose car was hit by the parachutist monday afternoon
karczewski said today he didn't think the parachutist was injured
witnesses told police the parachutist jumped off a building that was under construction and landed on the hood of alagbala's car
alagbala, 38, ``was waiting at the light when he saw a man roll off the hood with a parachute on,'' patrolman charles weyer said monday
he folded up his parachute, went running across the street and jumped into a car,'' said bonnie panagakis, 39, of palatine, who saw the incident
mrs. panagakis said she saw a man flying ``higher than the light poles'' above the chicago river
i think he saw he was about to go into the river, and he had to get himself righted,'' she said
she said that he maneuvered his parachute back toward the street but that the parachute was torn by a lamppost. ``that's when he landed on the guy's hood,'' she said
alagbala said the man caused between $300 and $500 damage to the car
more than 500 elementary school children and whale watchers stared in horror as a container ship hit a 35-foot gray whale as it swam four miles off shore, witnesses said
the 30-ton mother whale, which was escorting its calf along with another cow and calf pair, was hit saturday while migrating north toward the arctic
the children were just devastated. one little boy wanted to swim out and help the whale,'' said nancy pavlich, a first grade teacher at deer canyon elementary school in suburban alta loma
robert yoshitomi, a lawyer for nippon yusen kaisha (nyk), japanese owners of the container ship hakusan ii, said company officials were looking into the case
we're still checking,'' he said. ``we're sorry for any difficulty that was caused. as far as we know, it was unintentional.''
pavlich said many of the children were still somber about the incident monday morning and some students are writing letters about the whales and sending them to the coast guard
the whale slid along the side of the ship, broke free from the ship's current, swam helplessly for a minute than made a final blow of air before sinking, witnesses said
kids were screaming and crying as they were watching this,'' said bill samaras, a marine biology teacher at carson high school who was aboard the children's boat
we had been following the whales for about 15 minutes when we noticed the container ship coming from the southwest. it then very drastically turned and crossed our path
i thought, `they're going to hit the whales,' and we tried to contact the ship on the emergency radio but i guess they weren't monitoring the line.''
at this point we can't confirm its death, but there is a good chance that it died, we just can't say for sure,'' said tom lewis, biologist at the los angeles county museum of natural history and president of the american cetacean society
the hakusan ii, 209 feet long and with a dead weight of 20,934 tons, arrived at the port of los angeles on saturday and left sunday evening headed to taiwan, officials said
samaras, a research associate with the county museum, said he was certain the ship's navigators didn't see the swimming mammals
to them it was like a road kill,'' he said. ``like killing a chipmunk with your car,'' he said. ``i'm sure it was nothing intentional. they didn't know they hit it.''
samaras said he plans to file a complaint with the coast guard about the ship, which he said changed course and came about 150 yards in front of the whale watching charters
typhoon bola pounded the east coast of new zealand's north island today, killing at least one person and forcing the evacuation of 2,500 people
the high winds also fanned a bush fire on south island that consumed nearly 1,000 acres before it was brought under control
four towns and portions of gisborne were evacuated during widespread flooding, civil defense spokesman doug bent said. authorities declared a state of emergency
residents were ordered out of low-lying areas as a precaution against rising rivers. at least four people were lost in the floodwaters and one body was recovered, officials said
insurance companies estimated damage at hundreds of millions of dollars. the most serious damage was on the east coast of north island, where homes were heavily damaged as far north as auckland
in new plymouth on the west side of the island, winds damaged more than 300 homes and several high-rise buildings. bola was expected to pass over the north island later tuesday
winds of up to 93 mph began pounding the region late sunday as bola moved southwest across the pacific ocean after leaving more than 100 people homeless on the small island nation of vanuatu
a state of emergency was declared around gisborne and in wairoa after that town's main bridge collapsed
a man who killed one worshipper and wounded four others in a church shooting spree had been spurned by a former member of the congregation and talked about her after he was captured, parishioners said
cheun-phon ji, 29, a native of taiwan who earned a master's degree from emporia state university in december 1984, was charged monday with one count of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted first-degree murder. bond was set at $1 million and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for march 31
one person was killed and four wounded in the sunday morning shooting spree at calvary baptist church. parishioners wrestled the gunman to the ground after a church trustee chased him outside and struck him with a hymnal
as he was being brought to the courthouse monday past a crowd of journalists, ji was asked why the shootings occurred. he shouted, ``justice, revenge.''
church members said monday that ji had attended a church service or bible study with a woman named georgia ann mejia several years ago. he apparently was rejected by the woman when he asked her to marry him, they said
allen bush, a church trustee, said he and three other men surrounded ji outside the church after the shooting
he said, `don't you remember? don't you remember?''' bush said. ``we said, `remember what?' he said, `georgia.' more than one of us said, `georgia who?' at that point he answered, `georgia mejia.'''
mejia, 27, was married nov. 4, 1985 and her name is now georgia ann johnson, according to court records. she transferred to another baptist church about four years ago, her mother said
police detained nine journalists, assaulted a television soundman and confiscated their film during an anti-apartheid demonstration this morning by about 100 black women
riot and security police arrived outside the chamber of mines about 10 minutes after the peaceful protest began and the crowd began to disperse
police began taking journalists into custody, including crew members of the american network, cbs, and london-based world television news, and taking film out of photographers' cameras
soundman prince msuthu of world television news said police punched him with fists and poked him in the stomach with their batons. he said he had bruises on his arms and intended to file charges
other journalists saw police dragging him toward the vehicle and holding him in a wrist-lock
they were manhandling me, pushing me around up to the point where the recorder on my shoulder fell on the ground,'' he said. ``they put me into the truck and as i was getting into the truck one of them assaulted me, using the baton
they kept on punching me, saying that i am `cheeky,' '' msuthu said after he was released from police custody and his recorded cassette confiscated
police spokesman col. frans malherbe said police took nine journalists to police headquarters and confiscated their film. but he denied they were detained or arrested. he said they could face charges ``if they have done something wrong.''
we arrived on the scene and had to deal with the news people somehow. ... so we took them to an office at john vorster square,'' he said, adding that emergency regulations prohibit members of the news media from being at the scene of unrest
however, journalists at the scene disputed malherbe's statement that police gave notice the gathering was illegal
the protesters, members of the federation of transvaal women, called on the nation's largest mining houses and biggest foreign currency earners to take a tougher line against government restrictions on anti-apartheid organizations
the women sang ``god bless africa,'' and unfurled posters addressed to the chamber saying: ``your silence is conspiracy,'' ``bannings protect mine profits,'' ``unban democracy,'' and ``chamber of mines speak.''
the women's federation is an affiliate of the united democratic front, one of 18 organizations the government banned on feb. 24 from any political activity
the congress of south african trade unions, whose biggest affiliate is the 300,000-member black national union of mineworkers, was also banned from any political activity

a federal judge has tacked an additional 10 days onto a restraining order preventing two american banks from transferring an estimated $50 million to the national bank of panama
on monday, u.s. district judge lloyd f. macmahon extended the order he had issued thursday that prevented three banks from transacting any business with or transferring funds to the banco nacional de panama
he also said he would sign a stipulation dropping irving trust as the third bank in the suit, which was filed on behalf of the republic of panama at federal court in manhattan
ousted panamanian president eric arturo delvalle is still recognized by the u.s. government as the legitimate head of panama, and the order effectively prevents the funds from being transferred to the regime of gen. manuel antonio noriega, panama's military leader
assistant u.s. attorney kenneth handal told the court that irving trust had agreed to a permanent injunction against transferring funds until the situation in panama has been resolved
lawyers for marine midland and bankers trust told the court that the situation in panama remained unclear and said they would respect the court's wishes
criminal attorney barry slotnick asked to intervene on behalf of banco nacional de panama because of what he said was panama's urgent need for cash. banks in panama remained closed for a fifth day monday, sparking a demonstration by thousands of retired people unable to cash their pension checks
last wednesday another bank, republic national bank of new york, agreed to transfer $10 million to the federal reserve bank
two u.s. grand juries in florida indicted noriega on drug charges feb. 4. delvalle sought to dismiss noriega feb. 25, but was ousted the next day by noriega supporters and went into hiding
last tuesday, delvalle froze all panamanian assets outside the country

the rapides parish sheriff's office, trying to find local satanists, has ordered the library here to turn over a list of people who have checked out books on the occult in the last year
assistant district attorney dexter ryland said he has advised rapides parish library officials to withhold the information until his office can determine if the order is an invasion of privacy
we are working on it. we haven't formulated our final legal opinion on it,'' ryland said monday. ``it struck me when it was called to my attention that it could possibly violate the privacy of individuals.''
chief deputy tommy hollingsworth said his office is ``simply trying to get some intelligence'' on serious followers of satanic beliefs because ``a lot of times it is connected with narcotics.''
lynn dunn, who works in the sheriff's narcotics office, said the names and addresses were subpoenaed ``to weed out the curious from the serious'' followers of satanism
it is not an invasion of the readers' privacy ``because no one is going to be contacted or anything like that,'' she said
hollingsworth said his office is not investigating any specific incidents involving devil worshippers. the sheriff's office is simply updating files it has kept for the last 15 years, he said
library director stephen rogge said it is his policy not to release such information simply on a request, but he could be forced to comply because of the court order
rogge said he would consider the sheriff's request an invasion of privacy ``unless there is a good reason for it.'' if the district attorney's office determines there are not sufficient grounds to turn over the list, rogge said he won't do it
rapides chief of detectives william earl hilton said there may be some satanic activity in the parish, but so far it has not been linked to any crime. with car</head>
a south african diplomat has been charged with assault after his car hit a protester and a police officer outside a radio station where he had been interviewed
south burlington police chief john race said south african vice consul duke kent brown was arrested by south burlington police monday about a quarter-mile from the scene of the incident
brown was charged with simple assault, released on his own recognizance and ordered to appear in court in april. race said the charge carries up to a year in prison and a fine of $1,000
police said brown left the burlington area following his release and failed to make three other scheduled appearances
jim condon, news director at radio station wjoy-wqcr and a witness to the incident, said the protester who was struck, laurie larson of richmond, suffered minor bruises
race identified the injured officer as todd shepard and said he had suffered bruises on his leg
race said police had called the state department in washington to ask if brown was covered by diplomatic immunity and were told ``to treat this case like any other.''
a spokesman in the south african embassy in washington, third secretary heyn van rooyen, said brown is connected with the south african consulate in new york
van rooyen said, ``there are different degrees of diplomatic immunity,'' and he was not sure that consular officials are given the same degree of protection as those connected with embassies
race said he hoped police could proceed with the case. ``politics don't enter into the justice system, as far as i'm concerned.''
condon said about 30 members of the vermont committee on southern africa had gathered outside the station to protest brown's participation in a talk show, ``viewpoint,'' which was broadcast beginning at 9 a.m
he said brown left the station under police escort and made his way to a car in a nearby parking lot. brown got into the car and a few of the protesters sat on the hood, condon said
protesters were climbing off the hood of the car without any resistance, condon said, when brown ``hit the accelerator'' and the incident occurred
philip fiermonte, one of the leaders of the protest, said brown ``shows disregard for humanity, as (south africa's) apartheid policies have.''

iraq said its warplanes hit a ``very big naval target'' in the persian gulf today, breaking a three-week lull in attacks on iran's oil shipping
the two nations also kept up their brutal barrage of missile attacks, firing surface-to-surface rockets into each other's capital cities. iran accused the united states and france of helping iraq refit soviet-designed missiles to give them enough range to reach tehran
the official iraqi news agency said iraqi jets struck ``accurately and effectively'' at the naval target off the iran coast and returned safely to base
it was the first raid on a ``large naval target'' _ iraq's term for an iranian tanker _ since feb. 16. the last independently confirmed attack by iranian warplanes was on feb. 12
the last time that iran is known to have attacked a ship, in retaliation for iraq's air raids on its own shipping, was on feb. 11
since then, the two belligerents, at war for 7{ years, have battered each other's capitals with long-range missiles and struck other population centers with artillery and bombs
hundreds of civilian casualties are believed to have resulted from the bombardments
also today, iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani accused the united states and france of helping iraq modify soviet-made missiles to reach longer-range targets in iran. tehran is 290 miles from the iraqi border
iran's official islamic republic news agency reported that an iraqi missile crashed into a residential neighborhood of tehran about midnight, killing or wounding several civilians
state-run baghdad radio reported that iraqi gunners fired the missile into tehran, a city of 6 million, early today less than an hour after iran claimed it lobbed a projectile into baghdad
tehran radio said president ali khamenei, who visited a bombed tehran neighborhood, said ``our nation will never forget those who have assisted the criminal in perpetrating its crime.'' unlike rafsanjani, khamenei did not refer to any specific country
iraq's news agency confirmed the an iranian missile strike on a residential area in baghdad, saying civilians, including women, children and eldery people, were killed. no figures were given
iran's news agency said revolutionary guards today shot a missile at a ``military center'' at amarah, an iraqi town close to the border and halfway between baghdad and the southern port city of basra
the reports were monitored in nicosia
iraq said it fired three missiles into tehran on monday, and iran reported its revolutionary guards blasted baghdad with four missiles and launched a fifth at the northern city of mosul for the first time
iraq confirmed only two missiles crashed monday in baghdad, a city of 5 million, killing or wounding ``many civilians, including women and children.''
iraq says it has fired 42 projectiles into tehran since the missile duel began
the iranians have reported more than 30 missiles have hit tehran. they said revolutionary guards fired 25 long-range missiles on iraq during that period, 23 of them on baghdad. the iraqis have only acknowledged 19 hits on the capital and one on mosul
both sides reported air raids on each other's cities and artillery bombardment of border towns on monday
irna said 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 people wounded in monday's iraqi missile attacks on tehran's residential areas. it reported one missile demolished a clinic, a school and several houses
iran has listed at least 122 civilians killed and more than 300 wounded in the iraqi missile blitz, with more than 100 killed and more than 500 wounded in air raids over the last week. the iraqis have reported heavy civilian casualties, but gave no exact figures
iran last week accused moscow of supplying iraq with the missiles, triggering several violent protests outside the soviet embassy in tehran and the consulate-general in the central city of isfahan. the soviet union who, along with france, is main arms supplier of iraq, denied the charge
the soviet union, meanwhile, called for security council condemnation monday of the war
under the circumstances, the security council has to do something in order to eliminate the damage of the further escalation of the military conflict between iran and iraq,'' soviet ambassador alexander m. belonogov told reporters. graf pvs, ``they hurt; also subs 8th graf pvs, dukakis plans</note>
massachusetts gov. michael s. dukakis cast his democratic primary vote today at his hometown precinct in brookline, where he was greeted by neighbors who applauded his arrival
it's good to be in this precinct where a great deal of my political career and my life, really, has been shaped by a lot of great friends who are here,'' said dukakis, who was accompanied by his wife, kitty, and their daughter, kara
dukakis had closed his super tuesday campaign monday night, worrying about the last-minute impact of negative campaign ads aired by tennessee sen. albert gore in texas and north carolina
they hurt, there's no question about it,'' dukakis said as his campaign plane headed for boston on monday night after a day of campaigning in the south. ``by the time you find out what they're doing it's too late.''
dukakis said of the latest gore ad, ``it's a piece of garbage.''
the comments were a final note of concern following an otherwise upbeat weekend of campaigning that saw large crowds, extensive media coverage and a few key endorsements
dukakis planned to spend the day at his statehouse office and then fly to chicago to begin campaigning in the next battleground _ illinois, which holds its primary a week from today
in his final stop in the raleigh-durham area monday night, dukakis once again rejected the notion that he is the most liberal of the democratic candidates, saying he preferred the label ``progressive.''
among the positions that have helped pin the label liberal on dukakis are his opposition to aid to nicaraguan contra rebels, his opposition to any cuts in social spending, his opposition to a space-based missile defense system and the midgetman missile and his support of closer relations with soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev
but dukakis insisted that he has also cut taxes in massachusetts _ even though some of those tax cuts occurred over his initial objections. he said he has balanced nine consecutive budgets and has cut crime in massachusetts. in his work with other governors, he said the most consistently progressive are those from the southern states
in addition to stops in miami, plant city, fla., and raleigh-durham, dukakis squeezed 21 television interviews into his schedule monday
still, he said, ``don't let them tell you this is a television campaign. this is a grass-roots campaign and if we're successful, it will be because of our organization.''
the dukakis organization is recognized as the best-funded and most extensive in texas, florida and washington state, among the 20 super tuesday states holding presidential primaries and caucuses today. in north carolina, though, campaign organizers predicted dukakis would finish third there behind jesse jackson and gore
dukakis kicked off the day of campaigning in perhaps his most solid base of support in the south: miami
at a senior citizens rally, dukakis picked up the coveted endorsement of 70-year-old annie ackerman, not a household name, but someone with a reputation in miami for being able to get out the vote
the woman who was a ward organizer for chicago mayor richard daley spurned other democratic suitors and endorsed the massachusetts governor at a morning rally attended by about 500 senior citizens
a man who went without sleep for a week in order to watch over his wife, who reportedly suffered from alzheimer's disease, apparently shot her to death and then killed himself, officials said
the bodies of douglas and clodene schofield, both 67, were found monday morning at their home in a trailer park, said butler county coroner pete tutchtone
she had gotten to where she was straying away from the trailer,'' tutchtone said. ``i guess she had alzheimer's disease.''

some assemblies of god members have left the fold or are seeking counseling because of the rev. jimmy swaggart's alleged sexual misconduct, says a minister who has talked to the television evangelist
i hope to god there aren't any more'' sex scandals, added glyn lowery, pastor of pace assembly of god in this pensacola suburb. ``i don't know how we'll stand many more scandals in the assemblies of god. it has shaken our movement tremendously.''

he is a broken man,'' lowery said sunday. ``as he told me, `glyn, nobody could exact any punishment on me greater than that which i put upon my own self for what i done.' ''
church officials have proposed to relieve swaggart of his ministry for three months

libya's official news agency said today 130 foreigners, including one american, have been released from prison in libya
the jana news agency report, monitored in rome, carried expressions of gratitude from prisoners from west germany, italy and the united states
jana mentioned a ``u.s. prisoner'' and quoted him as expressing his happiness and gratitude
the belgian ambassador, camille reynens, reached by telephone from rome, said the american was staying at his residence but declined to give his name or any details about the case
belgium represents u.s. interests in libya
jana said the prisoners were released monday in a ceremony attended by diplomats from embassies in tripoli representing the various prisoners
the report did not say what the freed prisoners had been charged with, but the italian foreign ministry in rome said three italians released were businessmen accused by libya of defaulting on contracts
the jana dispatch quoted a libyan foreign ministry official as telling the diplomats that the prisoner release was an expression of the ``freedom and liberty'' brought by libya's 1969 revolution and evidence of its ``humanitarian aspect.''
last week, libyan leader col. moammar gadhafi, driving a bulldozer, knocked down a wall of a tripoli prison to release prisoners as part of an amnesty he declared. jana said 400 prisoners were freed
gadhafi announced he was releasing all libyan prisoners except those accused of plotting with foreign countries

a kuwaiti held his two wives and 13 sons at gunpoint for more than two days and fired randomly at police, injuring one man, before surrendering, the interior ministry said today
nasser farraj al-rukeibi released his family members unharmed and gave up late monday, a ministry spokesman said. one of the women was eight months pregnant and the eldest of the sons was less than 7 years old
police were interrogating al-rukeibi to determine his motives but they did not think the 58-hour standoff was related to his polygamous marriage, sources said. al-rukeibi, a moslem, is permittted by islamic law to have up to four wives
one neighbor was slightly injured by a stray bullet when al-rukeibi began firing in response to police attempts to talk him into releasing the hostages
police and special forces staked out the family home and used bullhorns to negotiate with al-rukeibi. authorities said he threatened to kill his wives and sons if the house was stormed
the sources, who could not be named under police regulations, said the standoff began saturday morning when al-rukeibi clashed with his personnel manager at the ministry of communications where he is employed
al-rukeibi pulled out a revolver and opened fire, but no injuries were reported. he then rushed to his car and drove to his home at firdous, a suburb 10 miles north of the city center, where took his wives and sons hostage
the brother of an american being held hostage in lebanon said today he thinks the hostages should be an issue discussed by the u.s. presidential candidates
they have never mentioned a word,'' said anthony cicippio, whose brother, joseph, has been held for 18 months
i think they're treating it like a hot potato. they're just laying off of it,'' he said on abc-tv's ``good morning america.''
he also chided members of congress for what he said was a lack of concern for the hostages
we sent 300 letters to the congressmen and senators over the last six months and, through that time, we've only received 13 replies,'' he said. one of them, whom he did not identify, asked for a campaign contribution, said cicippio, of norristown, pa
i live on hope,'' said peggy say, who joined cicippio on the program. her brother, terry anderson, chief middle east correspondent of the associated press, was abducted march 16, 1985. he has been held longer than any of the nine americans in captivity
mrs. say said increased activity involving the search for lt. col. william higgins, who was kidnapped three weeks ago, gives her some hope. but she said the hostage families should not ``have to wait for a time when we could attach ourselves to a larger issue.''

a bus carrying american tourists from israel to egypt today skidded on a wet highway east of the occupied gaza strip and flipped over, injuring all 56 people on board, hospital officials and radio reports said
the bus was taking members of the united methodist church, west virginia conference, on a tour of the middle east, said a church spokeswoman in charleston, w.va
debbie mcgraw, a church secretary, said the accident injured 55 tour members and the bus driver
the bus was carrying lay people and clergy from various parts of west virginia as well as relatives from virginia and possibly other states, mcgraw said
the u.s. embassy initially said all the passengers were from west virginia. it refused to identify any of the tourists
most of the americans suffered fractured limbs, including broken hands, wrists and shoulder bones, or cuts requiring stitches, said a surgeon in the emergency room of barzilai hospital in ashkelon, 40 miles southeast of jerusalem
five of the americans suffered more serious fractures that would require orthopedic therapy, but none were in critical condition, said the surgeon, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a telephone interview
police commander ezra menashe told army radio the accident occurred when the bus from the east jerusalem tourism co. went out of control on a curve on the road between miflasim and kfar azza, two kibbutzim or collective farms located about three miles east of the gaza strip
the radio said the driver lost control of the bus which careened onto a field adjacent to the highway and overturned
there was heavy rain and suddenly the bus overturned and everyone started screaming,'' passenger rick farley, of dunbar, w.va., told the itim news agency. ``people in passing cars provided some first aid and then the ambulances came.''
the bus, which departed from the northern city of tiberias, was headed for the egyptian border crossing at rafah, on the southern tip of the gaza strip, army radio said

an appearance by two members of the ku klux klan at a free speech forum turned into a massive demonstration at the university of kansas as protesters waved signs and shouted slogans
an estimated 3,000 people, some shouting ``kkk not today'' and ``don't go in,'' protested outside monday night as about 2,000 people gathered inside hoch auditorium
no serious violence was reported, but several windows were broken as protesters tried to push their way into the auditorium. police wearing riot gear guarded the entrances to the building, breaking up one shouting match and ejecting another person
the forum was delayed for about 20 minutes when eight black ministers from lawrence and kansas city stood up and began singing spirituals. the audience joined in and gave the ministers two standing ovations before the forum began
the ministers continued singing throughout most of the evening before marching out a side door in protest
one of the klan members, thom robb, of harrison, ark., accused the ministers of stifling free speech
these people are so filled with hatred and bigotry they refuse to let you hear us,'' said robb, national chaplain of the knights of the ku klux klan. he was accompanied by j. allen moran, exalted cyclops of the missouri knights of the ku klux klan
allan hanson, a professor of anthropology participating in the forum, told the students to listen to the klan members and make up their own minds
if you find the ideas here are ugly or twisted, use your own judgment and freedom of expression to tell other people that,'' hanson said
another participant, journalism professor ted frederickson, said he wanted to stand up for free speech, even though the klan had denied that right to people working for civil rights in the south
those people were met with bombs and guns and fists and violence,'' he said. ``but i believe in free expression, even for the klan.''
michael foubert, a graduate student and head of the group that sponsored the forum, said he invited the kkk members to the campus as a way of examining whether a university should support free speech for all viewpoints
foubert, director of ``slightly older americans for freedom,'' organized the forum after faculty members last month canceled a planned visit to campus by two klan members. the two had been scheduled to speak to a journalism class for an exercise on reporting on extremist groups and participate in a student radio talk show
black ministers in the lawrence area and the black student union had opposed the visit
david ambler, ku vice chancellor for student affairs, said the university did not interfere with the forum because it was sponsored by a student organization
students have a right to explore ideas. we're obligated to protect that right,'' ambler said. ``i hope a lot of learning goes on tonight.''
mia crawford, a black student from kansas city, kan., said she wasn't concerned that the klan would recruit any students
i'm against the kkk but they do have a right to speak,'' she said. ``i think a lot of people are here just out of curiosity.''
ninety-one junior high school students were sent to hospitals after a mysterious irritant caused rashes, blisters and breathing difficulties during physical education classes, authorities said today
chemicals were ruled out after a grounds check at rincon junior high school on monday and experts were concentrating on water contamination as a possible cause, said diane ho, a spokeswoman for the rowland unified school district
it is a mystery,'' said anastacio medina, chief of the county health department's hazardous materials control program
all but one of the seventh- and eighth-grade students were treated and released from hospitals by mid-afternoon, authorities said. one student, who was not identified, was kept overnight for observation of an asthmatic condition at inter-community medical center in covina, a nursing supervisor said today
paramedics accompanied students in ambulances and school buses to the hospitals after the first symptoms were reported monday morning, said west covina police lt. clint collins
the 700-student campus is part of the rowland unified school district in west covina, about 30 miles east of los angeles
experts from the san gabriel valley fire authority, the public health department, the department of agriculture and the walnut water district were called in to find the problem after the students started reporting swollen eyes, rashes, blisters or stomach cramps, ms. ho said
all of the youths had participated in one of three periods of physical education classes
we found no chemicals on the playgrounds,'' ms. ho said, adding that a couple of fleas were found in a grassy field area but none was known to cause such an intense reaction
none of the school's teachers or other adult employees experienced any symptoms, she said
the playgrounds were closed to all students after the outbreak was initially reported, but the rest of the school remained open
cbs inc. chairman william paley, who underwent emergency gall bladder surgery last month, was released from a hospital today after making a remarkable recovery, a spokeswoman said
paley, 86, was in critical condition following his feb. 11 surgery at new york hospital-cornell medical center
hospital spokeswoman myrna manners said paley had ``remarkably improved after one month in the hospital,'' and the network's founder was sent home this morning
paley bought the columbia broadcasting system, a fledgling radio network, in 1928. he controlled it for more than half a century, turning over the reins in 1983
when cbs's biggest stockholder, loew's corp., became unhappy with his successor's policies, paley teamed with loew's chairman lawrence tisch to retake control in 1986.   
the federal aviation administration, worried about a rash of commuter airline accidents that claimed 56 lives over a recent five-month period, today announced a year-long inspection of the commuter industry
faa administrator allan mcartor said the inspection will cover 173 commuter airlines. agency inspectors are planning to focus on about 20 percent of those carriers
mcartor said faa officials already are reviewing ``major problem areas'' in the industry, which last year carried 30 million passengers,
and plan within 60 days to begin inspections
teams of faa inspectors will focus on such areas as airline management, training programs, record keeping and aircraft condition
mcartor said the commuter airlines' safety record in recent months has sharply reversed from the trends seen in recent years. the faa cited seven commuter accidents from november through february in which 56 people were killed
the worst accident was that of a ryan air commuter nov. 13 near homer, alaska, in which 18 people died
commuter airlines have played an increasingly important role in the nation's aviation system because they often are used as feeder airlines for the major jet carriers at large airports around the country. last year the commuters carried nearly 30 million passengers, according to the regional airline association, and that number is expected to continue to climb
we want a return to the 1986 environment when commuters had the safest year in their history,'' mcartor told a news conference. in 1986, commuter airlines had just two fatal accidents in which four people were killed
faa officials said they expect the initial inspection phase of the commuters to be completed by the end of september. the agency then will prepare a final report on the findings, which would be used by inspectors responsible for the individual airlines in having corrective action taken

divine, the outrageous 300-pound female impersonator who starred in such cult classics as ``pink flamingos'' and ``lust in the dust,'' died at age 42 on the verge of acceptance as a legitimate character actor, his manager said
divine, whose real name was harris glenn milstead, was a garishly made up, loud and foul-mouthed character who was introduced in 1972's ``pink flamingos'' as ``the filthiest person alive.'' milstead made the same campy character suitable for a wider audience in the current movie ``hairspray.''
he was finally getting respect within the industry,'' said manager bernard jay. ``he was getting the legitimate screen and television offers that showed the industry had finally accepted him as the very good character actor he always knew he was.''
milstead, found in his bed at the hollywood regency plaza hotel on monday, apparently died of asphyxiation in his sleep, said publicist john west of pmk
the los angeles county coroner's office said it was investigating the cause of death
last friday, a doctor declared milstead in excellent health, other than his weight, ``which has been a constant problem throughout his life,'' said jay
milstead said in a 1985 interview he grew up fat and was taunted by classmates in the baltimore suburb of lutherville. milstead told an interviewer he had a fantasy life revolving around female movie stars and dreams of becoming a celebrity
milstead was made a celebrity, at least among fans of after-midnight art films, by one of his few friends from high school, director john waters
waters cast milstead in trashy and bizarre roles as the female-impersonating star of ``pink flamingos,'' ``lust in the dust,'' ``polyester'' and ``female trouble.''
i'd see him waiting for the school bus, wearing different color hair every morning,'' waters said in a recent interview with the los angeles times
i remembered my father would just flip out. he'd get so excited. so i thought _ wow! if divine can make my father that crazy, think of how great he'd be in a movie.''
despite his dressing in drag for acting roles, milstead wasn't a transvestite at heart, waters wrote in his book, ``shock value.'' ``he says he sometimes dreads getting into drag but realizes these flamboyant outfits are his `work clothes,''' waters wrote
with each film, waters and milstead found a wider audience. the waters-directed ``hairspray,'' a spoof of the 1960s, was rated no. 16 last weekend in the box office, earning $577,258 at 79 theaters
west said milstead was in los angeles to appear in an episode of the fox television network series ``married ... with children.''
milstead was to have appeared in that series dressed as a man, as he did playing a sydney greenstreet-type character in the 1985 film ``trouble in mind.''
in ``hairspray,'' milstead played dual roles. in men's clothing, he was a television station operator determined to keep black and white youngsters from appearing together on a dance show. as divine, he starred as the stage mother of a chubby, teen-age dance show contestant
the character is a real person,'' milstead once said of divine. ``sometimes she's just too bold, but she has socially redeeming qualities, no matter what she does. she's her own person and a lot of people like that. the camp element is something out of the ordinary, this big man playing a sexy woman.''
besides film roles, milstead also used the divine persona in a nightclub act

militant roman catholics rioted through the night and into the early morning over the killing of three unarmed irish guerrillas in gibraltar. the irish government said it was ``gravely perturbed'' at the shootings
youths in belfast pelted police with gasoline bombs and set ablaze several dozen automobiles in rioting that lasted into early today, police said. no injuries were reported
it was one of the worst nights of violence in the british-ruled province since last summer, and was touched off by the shooting of two men and a woman sunday in britain's fortress colony on spain's southern coast
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said monday that a ``dreadful terrorist act has been averted'' by the slayings
the three people killed were actively involved in the planning and attempted execution of that act,'' he told the house of commons in london
police in gibraltar said the three were believed to be involved in an irish republican army plan to detonate a car bomb at the governor's residence during a ceremonial changing of the guard today
fifty members of the royal anglian regiment, just transferred from duty in northern ireland, took part in the ceremony which occurred without incident
security was heavy as gibraltar police and british troops with dogs patrolled the fringes of a crowd of about 300 tourists and residents who watched the colorful ceremony in front of the convent, official residence of governor sir peter terry
the ira, which is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the british from northern ireland, acknowledged that the three guerrillas were on a mission but accused the british government of needlessly killing them
in dublin, prime minister charles haughey's government said it recognized the need for security forces ``to take all reasonable measures to combat terrorism.''
the government is, however, gravely perturbed that three unarmed irish people should have been shot dead ... when it appears from reports that they could have been arrested by the security forces,'' the government said
ireland is already embroiled in a series of disputes with britain over security forces in northern ireland, including britain's unwillingness to prosecute police officers who allegedly carried out a shoot-to-kill policy in the province
howe said the soldiers opened fire after the guerrillas parked a renault-5 with spanish license plates near the governor's residence and headed on foot for the spanish border 800 yards away
howe said the three guerrillas ``made movements which led security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.''
police searched gibraltar and adjacent spanish territory on monday for another car believed connected with the three. the theory is the renault-5 was reserving a space for a car bomb
howe said spanish police tipped off the british after a fourth ira guerrilla they were watching crossed into gibraltar, apparently to carry out ``reconnaissance for an act of terrorism.''
the london newspaper the daily mail said spanish police believe the fourth suspect may be evelyn glenholmes, who has been linked with several ira attacks in past years. it quoted them as saying a women of her description was seen visiting the other three at an apartment in malaga, two hours' drive from gibraltar
howe said a car for which the three slain guerrillas had keys was found parked on the spanish side of the gate separating this 2.25-square-mile limestone rock from the spanish mainland. he said it contained keys to a third car, three false passports and equipment including an alarm clock, insulating tape and wire that could be used to detonate a bomb
howe did not identify the british unit involved, but there was speculation they were from the elite special air services regiment, whose movements are secret. witnesses said they wore jeans
the outlawed ira, in a statement from belfast, identified the dead as: mairead farrell, 31, who had served 10 years jail for blowing up a hotel, sean savage, 24, and daniel mccann, 30, both of whom have been arrested on explosive charges
all three were from catholic west belfast, where the rioting broke out after howe's statement
in belfast, police fired plastic bullets to disperse gangs of youths who hurled gasoline bombs and set fire to 30 vehicles including buses, vans and trucks. gunmen launched at least two sniper attacks on police and troops, police said
the mainly catholic ira seeks to drive the british from northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province with the overwhelmingly catholic irish republic under socialist rule
the mayor has announced his resignation amid a criminal probe into the handling of client funds in his private law practice
the town council will decide on march 21 whether to appoint a replacement for richard kennett or call a special election. kennett also resigned his position as a council member
please accept my deepest and most sincere apology for any embarrassment and adverse publicity which in any way reflects poorly on our town, its staff or council,'' kennett said in a resignation letter dated friday
the letter did not mention a contra costa county district attorney's investigation into kennett's practice, officials said. kennett has said his attorney has advised him not to comment on the probe
district attorney gary yancey also refused comment because the case involved an ``ongoing investigation.''
kennett's attorney, william gagen, said at least part of the investigation stems from checks sent to debbie peterson of spokane, wash
peterson had hired kennett to settle her deceased mother's estate; the investigation involves checks that allegedly bounced
the state bar of california has ruled in a separate case that kennett failed to represent a client in divorce proceedings in a timely manner, had neglected the case of another client, and had failed to respond to inquiries from the state bar about these complaints
that ruling is going to the state bar's review panel for a recommendation on disciplinary action
kennett, 49, was elected to the danville town council in november 1985 and was named by fellow council members to a one-year mayor's term last december. danville is a suburban town of 7,000 about 20 miles east of san francisco. at his, etc.</note>

standing with his wife, barbara, beside his limousine under threatening skies, bush said, ``if we exceed our expectations or live up to them, i think we'll be in good shape.''
top campaign aides had said earlier that they thought bush stood a good chance of winning at least 12 or 13 state contests today
as bush prepared to await the returns here and in 16 other states, his aides were getting ready for a series of campaign strategy sessions wednesday
a principal focus of those sessions will be how to continue the vote-getting momentum as the competition moves to illinois and other states in the midwest
asked today if he had gained ``big mo'' over his opponents, bush replied, ``i never use that expression since 1980. i've learned since then.''
after upsetting ronald reagan in the 1980 iowa caucuses bush claimed he had achieved ``big mo.'' but then he went on to lose to reagan in new hampshire and subsequently pulled out of the race
i'm encouraged,'' bush said today when asked how well he would do. ``but regardless of what happens here, the battle goes right on to illinois.''
at his last public appearance on monday, in rogers, ark., bush said he was ``optimistic but not overconfident.''
asked what he'd do if he didn't win today, he replied: ``i'll have to do what i did when i got kicked in iowa _ get up off the canvas, go out and fight hard.'' after his third-place finish in iowa, bush went on to a solid win in the new hampshire primary eight days later
after a day of campaigning in arkansas, missouri and oklahoma, bush flew to his adopted hometown to vote in the texas primary and await the results
but his top campaign aides and leading southern strategists said they wouldn't be surprised if the vice president captured some 600 of the roughly 700 delegates at stake
such a scenario, said campaign manager lee atwater, could present republican presidential rival bob dole with a must-win scenario in next week's illinois primary
i don't know what dole does if he doesn't win illinois,'' atwater said. a dole campaign source agreed that the kansas senator has to win illinois and said the campaign is prepared to spend $500,000 on advertising there
bush seemed tired, but upbeat, as he toured an american airlines maintenance facility at tulsa's airport
the person that clearly wins super tuesday is going to be the nominee of the party and, i think, the next president,'' he said. ``it's critical.''
but bush brushed aside talk of a sweep. ``you always wish for that, but i certainly would never predict that. it's too much for anyone to expect.''
atwater said he expected bush to win 12 or 13 of the 17 gop events, and deputy campaign manager rich bond said the campaign is prepared to spend ``whatever it takes'' to win illinois
bush returned to houston almost five months from the day he declared his presidential candidacy here, saying ``i mean to run hard and i mean to win.''
bush is a native of massachusetts and was raised in connecticut, but he moved here with his wife, barbara, in 1948, to learn the oil business. he became a successful oilman before venturing into politics as a county republican chairman
i'm guardedly optimistic'' about bush's chances in texas, state campaign political kevin moomaw said. ``bob dole's campaign in texas is non-existent. the competition in this state has been pat robertson.''
moomaw said not even the forecast of heavy rains through much of texas would put a damper on bush's prospects
we are warning everybody to go out and vote,'' he said. ``there is a potential for a turnout of 750,000.''
ken wright, bush's florida campaign director, said ``we're looking good. i'd like to see us come out with 70 of the 82 delegates. i think we're going to do very, very well.''
bush got a lift with his lopsided victory in south carolina's primary on saturday. he had stumbled out of the starting gate, finishing behind dole and robertson in iowa. but bush bounced back to win by a comfortable margin in new hampshire, and has done well since, although he did not compete in minnesota and withdrew from south dakota a week before losing that contest to dole
two former leaders of a strict religious group have surrendered their passports and agreed to stay in the united states pending trial on charges involving the death of a 10-year-old diabetic boy
doug kleber and jeffrey siegel, both of champaign, ill., posted $2,500 bond after being charged with second-degree criminal mistreatment and were released from the spokane county jail monday, officials said
kleber, former national leader of the so-called ``no name fellowship,'' and siegel, former head elder of the spokane branch, are among seven people being investigated in the dec. 20 death of aaron norman. an autopsy determined the boy died from untreated juvenile diabetes
at issue is whether the normans and church leaders knew the boy was seriously ill but withheld medical care because of their religious beliefs. leaders have said the church believes in the power of prayer, and former members say the church distrusts doctors and institutionalized medicine
the boy's parents, bob and judith norman, are being investigated for homicide by abuse, said county deputy prosecutor clark colwell
the normans did not seek medical help prior to the child's death, but contacted church leaders after trying unsuccessfully to revive the boy using cardiopulmonary resuscitation, according to sheriff's deputies
the boy was disciplined by spanking on the advice of church leaders the day before he died, authorities say. a pathologist determined the spanking did not contribute to the boy's death but said bruises were found on his buttocks and legs
kleber has said that neither he nor the normans knew the boy was seriously ill and that they would have taken him to a doctor if they had known
the normans have been members of the spokane fellowship since it started in in 1981, but the branch announced last weekend it had disbanded
since the boy's death, the normans' youngest son, 8-year-old david, has been put in foster care by state officials
three others charged with criminal mistreatment are mark roloff, 33, the head elder of the former spokane branch, and church members john johnson, 37, and steve arden of spokane, colwell said
arraignment for all defendants will be scheduled in the next several weeks in superior court, officials said
the church said it has about 200 members in spokane; champaign; plano, texas; and passaic, n.j. it was formed in the 1970s in illinois primarily as a bible-study group for athletes. giving more details</note>
supreme court justice sandra day o'connor had her appendix removed at bethesda naval hospital on monday night and was reported in good condition today
court spokeswoman toni house said o'connor, 57, was feeling ``exceedingly well'' but gave few other details
o'connor arrived at the hospital in mid-afternoon monday, and was operated on about 8 p.m., house said
a hospital spokesman said all details of o'connor's medical treatment would have to come from house's office
o'connor had been scheduled to testify, along with justice antonin scalia, before a house appropriations subcommittee today about the supreme court's budgetary requests for fiscal year 1989
an opposition spokesman said riot police clashed today with hundreds of student protesters in krakow, while at warsaw university thousands of students demonstrated peacefully to demand greater academic freedom
about 70 to 100 people were detained in krakow, but police began releasing them by early afternoon, opposition activist zygmunt lenyk said. he said at least three people were severely beaten by police
the demonstrations coincided with the anniversary of march 8, 1968, student protests at warsaw university against censorship and political repression, which were brutally broken up by police and communist party worker activists
this year's protests reflected a renewed campaign by student activists urging communist authorities to legalize the independent students union, known as nzs, which was outlawed following the december 1981 martial law crackdown on the independent labor federation solidarity
at krakow's jagiellonian university, about 700 students tried to march to the main square in the city's old town following a noon campus rally organized by the nzs, but found the street cordoned off by police, lenyk said
lenyk, quoting eyewitness accounts, said police attacked the crowd with clubs, but some demonstrators pushed their way through police lines to reach the square, where they were detained
he said most of the students returned to campus and tried twice more to march to the square, about 500 yards away, but each time were attacked by police
a government spokesman, asked about the reported clash and violence, said he had no information and promised to look into the matter
at warsaw university, police did not intervene as more than 2,000 students peacefully demonstrated without leaving campus
students and university workers, carrying dozens of banners demanding legalization of the nzs and solidarity free trade union, marched to a campus carrying a plaque commemorating the 1968 protests
the plaque was put up in march 1981 when both solidarity and the nzs functioned legally
university authorities allowed the rally, but the campus' main gates were locked and security guards kept non-university personnel from entering
after students and faculty members laid wreaths under the plaque, campus nzs leaders stood on top of a wall to take turns speaking to the crowd through a bullhorn. cited</head>
a judge had refused to allow the release of fbi surveillance records tracking the political activities of late beatle john lennon because their disclosure could compromise national security
the request for release of lennon's fbi dossier was made by university of california, irvine, professor jon wiener under the freedom of information act. wiener said he will appeal the ruling by u.s. district judge robert takasugi
the decision came in response to a 1983 lawsuit filed by wiener when the fbi released only part of lennon's file, which contains documents about the musician's anti-war activities in the 1970s
they claimed some of these documents would damage national security,'' wiener said. ``to me, it sounds like a ridiculous thing to say about 18-year-old documents about the political activities of a dead rock star.''
lennon was murdered outside his new york city apartment in 1980
the ruling came last week after a closed-doors meeting between takasugi and government attorneys. to 1904, sted 1908</note>
actor robert livingston, who rode the range in dozens of movies and was the only lone ranger to remove his mask, has died. he was 83
livingston, who died at his tarzana home monday, had been battling emphysema, and was seriously ill for the last eight months, said his publicist, samuel m. sherman
when livingston appeared in the 1939 movie ``the lone ranger rides again,'' republic pictures had him remove the mask briefly so that he would be associated in the public's mind as the lone ranger, said livingston's son addison randall
actor clayton moore played the lone ranger on radio and television
born robert e. randall in 1904, in quincy, ill., livingston chose a stage name rather than compete with his younger brother addison ``jack'' randall, who later was killed in a screen accident
as stoney brooke, one of the ``three mesquiteers,'' livingston rode the range with two cowboy pals through 29 of the republic pictures films. when he left for other roles, his replacement was a then little known actor named john wayne, said sherman
his other films included ``the bold caballero,'' 1937; ``mutiny on the bounty,'' with clark gable, 1935; ``pistol packin' mama,'' 1943; ``daredevils of the clouds,'' his last picture for republic, 1948; ``once upon a horse,'' 1958, and ``blazing steweardesses, 1975

contra leader adolfo calero said today that the rebels would not attend cease-fire negotiations the sandinista government had scheduled to begin wednesday in nicaragua
calero said in a telephone interview from miami that government officials talked to the rebel leaders on monday ``at the last minute'' to tell them ``that they were ready for a meeting.''
apparently what the sandinista government wants is a unilateral show...,'' he said. ``we are not willing to attend a unilateral meeting set up by the sandinistas.''
three days of talks were to be held at the frontier post of sapoa, about 90 miles from the capital of managua along the southern border with costa rica
calero said the rebels may agree to hold talks at a later date in sapoa
he complained the government had not responded to a statement the rebels issued last week calling for cardinal miguel obando y bravo to continue participating in the talks as a witness and for the talks to center on wider issues than just arrangements for a cease-fire between the warring sides
president daniel ortega proposed the talks last week. he also said obando y bravo, head of the roman catholic church in nicaragua, would no longer serve as a mediator as he had in previous discussions
ortega said the government delegation to the talks would be headed by his brother, humberto ortega, the defense minister and one of nine members on the ruling national directorate
the contras named calero to head their delegation, but insisted that the cardinal be a witness at the meeting
late monday, the government said obando y bravo and joao baena soares, secretary general of the organization of american states, had agreed to serve as witnesses
the government maintains the talks should focus on the laying down of arms as outlined in the regional peace plan signed last august by the presidents of nicaragua, el salvador, guatemala, costa rica and honduras
the rebels want the discussions to be expanded to include a proposal put forth last month in guatemala city by the cardinal
obando y bravo's agenda called for the government to grant total amnesty to political prisoners, review a mandatory military draft law, allow full press freedom and renew a dialogue with its internal opposition. in return for the concessions, the contras were to accept a 30-day cease-fire
the u.s.-backed rebels have been fighting against the sandinista government since november 1981
the hermit of chestnut hill,'' who lived in makeshift huts on government land for nearly two decades and resisted well-publicized efforts to relocate him, died the way he would have wanted, says a friend
he died free, so to speak,'' said clyde raymond. ``he had his own drummer and stuck with it.''
bill britt, 52, had been dead for several months when he was found monday by two of his three childen, ingrid boughner of belmont and britton steven boughner of medford, boston police spokesman scott gillis
his body, dressed in multiple layers of clothing, was almost skeletal because of decomposition and animals, gillis said
dr. stanton kessler of the suffolk county medical examiner's office said today that autopsy results showed britt died of hypothermia. he said identification of the body was ``presumptive,'' because rats had eaten away most of britt's face and other exposed areas
kessler said britt's feet were found dug into the ground, as if to gain some warmth
born britton william boughner in wealthy chestnut hill, britt had lived on nearby land controlled by the metropolitan district commission since 1969. his hut was about 30 feet inside the fence surrounding evergreen cemetery, in the area of a large reservoir on the boston-brookline border
in his case, he felt that this was where he wanted to live, this was his estate,'' said raymond
in 1985, officials started trying to move britt, who was legally blind and lived on money from collecting cans and bottles for the deposits. when he refused welfare and several attempts to relocate him to public or subsidized housing, the news media dubbed him ``the hermit on chestnut hill.''
in may, britt's plastic and wood wigwam was destroyed in a fire. he was in new york city at the time appearing on the ``late night with david letterman'' television show because of the publicity his case attracted
state appeals court judge edith fine issued a stay preventing authorities from removing britt from the property. but when the appeals court order expired in july, officials removed his rebuilt wigwam and his belongings
britt rebuilt it again despite deteriorating health. an opthalmologist testified at a housing court hearing a year ago that britt had ulcers and he needed a corneal transplant. also, britt was nearly toothless
last year, he said he was writing a ``hermit's cookbook,'' but the manuscript and other papers relating to his legal battles were lost in the may fire. graf pvs, the assistant.</note>
a justice department official today proposed raising congressional salaries to as much as $175,000 in exchange for dropping the ``double standard'' that exempts congress from federal ethics laws
i personally am attracted by the idea of raising the salary of all members of congress to a level around somewhere between $150,000 and $175,000 a year,'' assistant attorney general william weld said in a speech attacking public corruption
this would enable you to do some other things like prohibit honoraria,'' added weld, who is in charge of the department's criminal division. ``it would be very, very expensive, and ... worth every penny.''
members of the executive branch and independent agencies are prohibited from supplementing salaries with fees and honoraria for job-related activities. violators are subject to up to a year in prison
congressional salaries are now $89,500 a year, which senators may supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed 40 percent of their salaries. the percentage for house members is 30 percent
weld said the payment of $2,000 fees to members of congress who visited a business establishment over which their committee had jurisdiction ``would be a laydown criminal case if performed by somebody in the executive branch.''
you have the double standard (of) criminal acts by one branch of government'' being legal in another ``and that really is neither logical nor is it consonant with the notion of fair play,'' weld said in remarks at the national press club
he said raising congressional salaries and applying the ban on outside payments would end ``any risk that these fees or honoraria would be influencing a legislator's sense of how to spend his time, much less his vote.'' higher salaries might attract talented people who otherwise would be unable to afford being in congress
in response to questions, he rejected the suggestion that his comments were an attempt to overshadow the fact that a number of reagan administration officials are under criminal investigation or have been convicted of crimes
my remarks today are the same as remarks i've been giving ... since 1978,'' said weld, a former u.s. attorney in boston and a former candidate for state attorney general in massachusetts
weld's boss, attorney general edwin meese iii, is under investigation in the wedtech scandal and in connection with a $1 billion proposed iraqi pipeline project that may have involved planned payoffs to the israeli labor party
weld also criticized congress for excluding itself from coverage of conflict-of-interest laws, which former white house political director lyn nofziger was convicted last month of violating on behalf of scandal-plagued wedtech corp. and two other clients
the assistant attorney general noted the lack of restrictions on lobbying by former congressmen
the day after a congressman leaves office, he is free to lobby his former colleagues on behalf of himself or his friends or clients, while continuing to enjoy full access to the house and senate floors,'' said weld. ``as recent events have made abundantly clear, such behavior by a former member of the executive branch would land one in jail.''
nofziger, under the 1978 ethics in government act, was found guilty of lobbying his former agency within one year after he left the government on matters in which the agency had been substantially involved
the matters pertained to a federal contract for wedtech, the continued production of a10 anti-tank aircraft and civilian manning of navy ships
nofziger faces sentencing later this month. 0989</first> comment from gay men's health crisis</note>
aids experts have sharply criticized a book by the sex experts dr. william masters and virginia johnson that claims to find wide spread of aids among heterosexuals
they have not done even the most rudimentary things to establish any representativeness of their results,'' says dr. june osborn, a virologist, pediatrician and dean of the school of public health at the university of michigan
in the book, released monday and titled ``crisis: heterosexual behavior in the age of aids,'' masters and johnson reported finding a 5 percent aids infection rate in men who said they had at least six sexual partners a year for five years, and a 7 percent infection rate in similarly active women
by comparison, federal figures released in february that cover the period from 1985 to sept. 30 show that 5,890 of 3.96 million military recruits tested positive, a rate of 1.5 cases of aids infection for every 1,000 people tested
based on their study of 800 people, masters and johnson concluded: ``the aids virus has certainly established a beachhead in the ranks of heterosexuals, and ... the odds are that the rate of spread among heterosexuals will now begin to escalate at a frightening pace.''
osborn contended that no such conclusion can be reached because the 800, including some people recruited with sign-up sheets on bulletin boards, were not chosen to be representative of the u.s. population
lori behrman, spokeswoman for the manhattan-based gay men's health crisis, today called the findings unscientific and expressed concern that they would harm anti-discrimination efforts
they have squandered their credibity to exploit a public health issue,'' said behrman. ``they have succeeded in alarming the public and have undone the good work that public officials have done around the country. you don't raise false alarms around an issue so potentially explosive as aids.''
late monday on abc-tv's ``nightline,'' masters defended the unscientific sample as a preliminary step, ``raising an alarm'' about the possibility there are heterosexuals outside the known risk groups who are in danger from the aids epidemic
what we haven't realized is that there is another group of those heterosexuals who have a very multiplicity-of-partners type of sex life, and that is all that the experiments demonstrated,'' masters said
masters denied that at a morning news conference the authors had backed off the book's claim that aids was ``running rampant'' among heterosexuals
we think that it is spreading very rapidly in the heterosexual population. we used the word rampant advisedly, because we think that we are facing a situation where there is tremendous danger.''
dr. peter fischinger, aids coordinator for the public health service, disagreed earlier monday, saying, ``we don't see an explosion into the heterosexual community.''
he noted that nationwide screening of blood donors has found that only about one in 40,000 shows evidence of infection with the aids virus. but he added, ``this does not mean we can be complacent about it.''
mathilde krim, chairwoman of the american foundation for aids research, said, ``masters and johnson may have expertise in sexuality, but they have no credentials to justify their recommendations concerning aids public health policy _ recommendations that will surely alarm the public.''
masters and johnson and their co-author, dr. robert kolodny, a director of the masters &amp; johnson institute in st. louis, also resurrected the nearly universally discarded notion that aids can be spread by casual contact
it does a disservice to the public to suggest once again that you can get this from kissing,'' said dr. stephen joseph, new york city's public health commissioner. the authors also called for widespread mandatory testing for aids, a recommendation that has been opposed by most public health authorities
i don't see anything in their own data that would lead one to make the sweeping statements about casual transmission and mandatory testing that i think they've made,'' said joseph
at their news conference, masters, johnson and kolodny appeared to disavow some of the claims they made in the book. kolodny acknowledged writing that kissing could spread aids, but said under harsh questioning from reporters that it was only a very small theoretical possibility
kolodny said today on abc's ``good morning america'' that the authors had ``carefully worded'' their statements ``to say, for instance, of the restaurant situation, as a practical matter, there's no risk.''
but should we be, as scientists, dishonest with the public and say there's no risk at all, none, when the history of this epidemic has been that every year new revelations come forth?'' he added
joseph, on cbs' ``this morning,'' said that he feared a backlash against ``alarmist and unsupported numbers.''
there is a real threat from heterosexual transmission, it's a major part of the epidemic, but blowing it out of proportion, as masters and johnson have done, i think will hurt the credibility of the issue in the end
with aids its not who you are, its what you do. anyone who engages in high-risk behavior, any heterosexual person who is a partner of someone who is in a primary risk group, a bisexual man or a man who uses iv drugs, is at risk,'' joseph said
asked at monday's news conference to back up the book's statement that ``the aids virus is now running rampant in the heterosexual community,'' masters said, ``i simply believe this.'' johnson said, ``i'm not sure we chose the word `rampant' ourselves.''
osborn criticized the authors for being secretive about their findings. she said masters and johnson attended an aids workshop at the kinsey institute in bloomington, ind., in december and ``they didn't give any clue that three months later this would come out.''
it does, to me, shake my confidence in their scientific purpose,'' she said
two former executives of a firm subcontracted to work on the b-1 bomber pleaded guilty to charges involving a fraudulent check-cashing scheme and illegal overbilling for time spent working on the military jet
robert f. butler, former owner of butler industries and purkey co. inc., and steven wooten, former general manager of butler industries, entered their pleas monday before u.s. district judge stephen v. wilson
the pleas were part of a deal in which the defendants acknowledged the government's case against them but claimed they never intended to violate the law, said butler's attorney, gerson s. horn. the arrangement allows them to present their defense in any civil litigation arising from the case
it would have taken a tremendous amount of money to fight this case,'' horn said. ``the government threatened to indict more'' unless the plea bargain was accepted
one of the three federal grand jury indictments accused both butler and wooten of overbilling rockwell inc., the aerospace contractor on the u.s. air force's b-1 bomber, for time spent changing orders on parts for the bomber
rockwell was billed for 495 hours of work on the subcontract, 445 more than were actually involved, said assistant u.s. attorney j. stephen czuleger. the billing amounted to $200,000 in erroneous charges, government officials said
horn said, however, that several company employees could present testimony to show that the amount of time devoted to the change orders was not overestimated
the other indictment charged butler, 54, and wooten, 30, with cashing company checks valued at more than $144,000 made out to fictitious payees over a two-year period. the checks were then illegally deducted on corporate tax returns as a cost of goods sold, czuleger said
butler was indicted in another bogus check-cashing scam of more than $259,000 involving purkey co. inc
horn said the two men claim they were writing the phony checks to obtain cash for real business expenses. the company was habitually overdrawn and would otherwise have been unable to get the money, he said
butler, who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, presenting false claims to the united states, subscribing to a false corporate income tax return and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return, faces a maximum two years in prison and $240,000 in fines. he will be sentenced june 20
wooten, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in two of the indictments, faces one year and fines of $130,000. he will be sentenced april 25
u.s. coast guard vessels have stopped almost 500 haitians attempting to enter the united states illegally in the past three days, a spokesman said today
since saturday three cutters have intercepted four sailing vessels crammed with haitians off the bahamas, said service spokesman luis diaz
the figures in the past three days have almost doubled the number of haitians stopped this year, he said, adding the weather alone could not explain the sudden surge in interdictions
the seas are calm at the moment, but it definitely has to be the economic situation in their country,'' said diaz
on saturday a sailing vessel with 192 people was stopped off great inagua, and since then three other ships have been stopped near crooked island, said diaz
one intercepted today had 90 aboard ``and still counting,'' said diaz
the 1,186 total since jan. 1 is running well ahead of last year's total of 3,556 people caught and returned to haiti, he said. graf pvs ``today's release.. ''</note>
a british relief worker and his syrian aide were freed today, five days after being taken captive in south lebanon, a sunni moslem leader said
the briton, peter coleridge, told reporters in the southern port city of sidon that there had been ``no kidnapping'' and that he and omar traboulsi were detained because they took photographs without authorization
mustafa saad, the sunni leader whose militia controls sidon, said palestinian guerrillas freed coleridge, the 44-year-old middle east coordinator of the british oxfam relief agency, and traboulsi, a 31-year-old syrian who is the agency's representative in lebanon. they were taken captive thursday at sidon's ein el-hilweh palestinian refugee camp
saad said by telephone that representatives of fatah-revolutionary council, the radical faction headed by abu nidal, turned the two captives over to him at his house in sidon at 3:50 p.m
the release of coleridge and traboulsi leaves 22 foreigners missing and presumed kidnapped in lebanon. they are nine americans, four frenchmen, three britons, one irishman, one italian, one west german, one indian, and two unidentified men. the longest held is terry a. anderson, 40, chief middle east correspondent for the associated press, who was kidnapped march 16, 1985
lebanese security sources have said abu nidal's guerrillas seized coleride and traboulsi when they saw coleridge taking pictures of parts of ein el-hilweh
i made a mistake by not asking for a permission (to shoot pictures) from the authority in ein el-hilweh,'' coleridge told reporters at saad's home
i know and respect the people who took us. there has been no kidnapping. it was clear from the beginning that i made a mistake. they were only applying security procedures,'' he said
coleridge, clean-shaven and dressed in dark blue trousers and a beige jacket, said he ``didn't lose hope'' during his captivity
we were well treated. we were held at around 4 p.m. thursday near the place we photographed in ein el-hilweh. three hours later they moved us blindfolded to another place. omar and i were in separate rooms all the time,'' he added
traboulsi did not talk to reporters
today's release came one week after two u.n. relief workers were freed in southern lebanon
jan stening of sweden and william jorgensen of norway had been abducted near the south lebanon's provincial capital of sidon feb. 5. they were freed march 1
their employer, the u.n. relief and works agency, said today it would consider resuming some of its activities in the war-torn country
but unrwa, in a statement released in vienna, austria, said it would not resume full operations in lebanon without minimum guarantees of security for its foreign workers there

the health ministry declared a meningitis epidemic tuesday, saying 20 people have died of the disease in recent days and 600 are hospitalized
meningitis normally strikes in sudan every summer, but this year it began a month earlier than usual early because of unseasonably early high temperatures. the temperature tuesday was 111 degrees fahrenheit
the health ministry said khartoum has been declared an ``epidemic-hit area'' and added the government was using all its capabilities to deal with the situation
it said another 148 cases have been reported from other regions in sudan
the statement said the disease was widely spread within overcrowded shanty towns around the capital, where an estimated 750,000 people from southern sudan are seeking refuge from famine and civil war in the south
trophy hunters killed a rare indian antelope at an animal park with a crossbow, then beheaded it, police said
it was the second such incident since 1983 at the symbio animal gardens at stanwell park south of sydney, police said monday
i suppose they will stick the head on a wall and boast about it,'' said park owner bob grover. ``they probably wanted it because of its long, spiraling horns.''
the antelope, named rajah, was beloved by the thousands of children who visited each year. the park staff said its mate, rajeesh, was pining for its companion
police said the poachers also skinned the animal after shooting it at close range
thieves tunneled into a jewelry store through the floor of an adjacent hotel, silenced its alarms and stole $1.6 million in gems, according to a news report
burglars using a blowtorch cut open a safe in the furst jewelry store and took out keys that opened a second safe where the jewels were kept, the italian news agency ansa reported monday
the thieves entered the store by cutting a hole in the floor of the hotel majestic that was closed for renovation and silenced the alarms by cutting telephone lines and pulling one alarm out of the wall, ansa said
store owner manlio bertucci, 36, said someone tried to break into the downtown store several years ago by throwing hand grenades through the front window. he said metal blinds kept the thieves from getting into the store
china has successfully launched into orbit its 22nd satellite, a synchronous communications satellite, it was reported tuesday
the nationally televised evening news showed a long march 3 rocket blasting off monday night from a launch site in xichuang, sichuan province

the long march 3 is china's most sophisticated rocket
reports have said the three-stage rocket's launch capabilities were nearly doubled last year, and it can now put a payload of 2{ tons into geosynchronous orbit 22,320 miles above earth
china launched its first satellite in 1970 and has recovered all 10 of the retrievable satellites it put into space
it began offering launch services for foreign countries last year. two u.s. companies have contracted with china to launch communications satellites this year. china also is to put a norwegian satellite into orbit in 1991
deng yingchao, widow of premier chou en-lai and one of china's most respected women, will resign as head of a prestigious advisory body, it was reported tuesday
deng, 84, will be among 600 people who will give up their seats on the national committee of the china people's political consultative conference, which will hold its annual session from march 24, the official xinhua news agency said
she told a meeting of the conference's standing committee the resignations will revitalize the advisory body, which is made up of prominent members from the communist party, non-communist groups and mass organizations
the standing committee approved a list of 2,081 for the new national committee, xinhua said
at the age of 21, deng joined the party and married chou. she was one of only about 50 women to complete the 7,750-mile long march in 1934-35
after chou's death in 1976, she began to play a more prominent role in politics, gaining a seat on the policy-making politburo in 1978
often referred to as china's ``elder sister,'' she and chou adopted about 10 war orphans, including acting premier li peng
the report did not say who would succeed her
west german prosecutors are investigating more than 1,100 cases of suspected nazi war crimes, the country's chief nazi hunter said tuesday
there are still formal investigations of 1,164 persons,'' said prosecutor alfred streim, chief of west germany's office for nazi war crimes investigations
streim's office in the southern city of ludwigsburg also has checked out 18,000 names on a list of possible war crimes suspects received from the united nations war crimes commission archives in 1986, the statement said
in january, streim said he had added 10 prosecutors to his staff to help with the increased workload in investigating 4,500 war crimes suspects from the u.n. list. the rest of the suspects had either died, or had been cleared or convicted in previous trials
according to federal statistics, 91,481 people have been investigated by west german officials since the end of world war ii, with 6,482 ending in convictions. of those, 12 were sentenced to death, 160 to life imprisonment, and the rest to lesser punishment, the statement said
former mayor dianne feinstein would stand a good chance of winning the democratic nomination for governor in 1990, according to a california poll released tuesday
the poll showed feinstein leading attorney general john van de kamp, state schools superintendent bill honig and controller gary davis among registered democrats questioned
none of the democrats has announced plans for 1990, and gov. george deukmejian, a republican, has not said if he will seek a third term
feinstein had the support of 47 percent of democrats in northern california and 25 percent in southern california. she was the first pick of 34 percent statewide
van de kamp was the favorite of 34 percent of southern california democrats, 13 percent in the north and 26 percent statewide. honig was picked by 12 percent statewide and davis by 10 percent
the poll found that feinstein was the choice of 42 percent of all registered voters while deukmejian was favored by 48 percent. ten percent of those questioned were undecided
the survey of 769 registered voters was conducted feb. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percent. the democratic gubernatorial preference of 356 registered democrats had an error margin of plus or minus 5.2 percent
president roh tae-woo's ruling party rammed its version of a new election law through the national assembly on tuesday with an impromptu voice vote, clearing the way for crucial legislative elections
after the law was passed during an unruly assembly session that drew shouts of outrage from opposition lawmakers, officials of the ruling democratic justice party said national assembly elections would be held about april 20
the two sides squabbled over the legislation for hours when vice national assembly speaker chang sung-man, protected by guards, went to the podium, called for a voice vote and quickly declared the bill passed
opposition lawmakers tried to block the move but were caught off guard. some rushed the podium but were stopped by guards. a brief scuffle broke out between ruling and opposition lawmakers, but nobody was hurt
it is regrettable that the assembly could not proceed smoothly, although we made concessions up until the last minute,'' said democratic justice party spokesman you kyung-hyun
you said his party had to pass the bill before the current assembly session ended tuesday in order to hold the general elections by april 28, the legal deadline. he said at least 35 days are needed to prepare
but kim tae-ryong, spokesman for tminister wu xueqian, said the united states and china ``have a very cordial relationship between ... and we want to continue it.''
as the two leaders posed for pictures in the oval office, a reporter asked reagan if he would urge china to stop selling silkworm missiles to iran. ``we're going to be talking about a great many things,'' reagan replied
when the reporter asked if their talks would involve the silkworms, reagan replied, ``you know the rules,'' apparently suggesting that reporters should not ask questions
wu met monday with secretary of state george p. shultz and with defense secretary frank c. carlucci
during toasts following a state department luncheon on monday, shultz and wu hailed the progress in bilateal relations and made almost no reference to issues dividing them
chief among those issues is china's reported sales of military weaponry to iran in defiance of u.s. efforts at the united nations to win support for a worldwide arms embargo against iran
the administration has been seeking assurances from china that it will not veto an embargo resolution
last october, the united states retaliated against china for selling silkworm anti-ship missiles to iran by suspending the process under which china had been given increasing access to u.s. products with advanced technology
since then, china has said it has stopped selling silkworms to iran
shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent anti-chinese rioting in tibet. state department spokesman charles redman said between three and nine people are believed to have been killed, and he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in tibet
a man who claims he was bitten by a black widow spider during a church bingo game has sued the church
kevin w. leonard is suing holy spirit catholic church for $1,004.91 in medical bills, $67 in lost wages and an unspecified amount for physical pain and mental anguish
leonard said he was bitten on the lower leg as he sat at a bingo table last june. a doctor later diagnosed the bite as having come from a black widow spider, according to matt parmenter, leonard's attorney
the spider's venom can affect the central nervous system, although it is generally not fatal to adults
the suit claims negligence on the part of the church and the diocese
the rev. patrick foster, pastor of holy spirit, declined to comment on the suit, filed friday in vanderburgh superior court
dallas county historical foundation officials say $700,000 in private donations were pledged for an exhibit on events surrounding the assassination of president john f. kennedy
officials also received promises of an additional $100,000 toward the $1.5 million needed for the museum on the sixth floor of the former texas school book depository building
we are halfway home,'' former dallas county judge david fox, a co-chairman of the fund drive, said monday. fox said officials expect to raise the remaining money within the next four months
county officials announced they would form a committee to begin the process of having the dealey plaza area designated a national historic landmark
last week, commissioners approved spending $2.3 million in county funds for constructing an outside elevator, to be used to carry visitors to the sixth floor, where lee harvey oswald was believed to have perched on the day of the kennedy assassination, nov. 22, 1963. man, sted woman, that mother was riding in motor home and not in lead car, deleting reference to motor home impaled on pipe, adding id</note>
a man driving his four grandchildren to a family reunion hit a tractor-trailer rig, causing a four-vehicle pileup and fire that killed him, the children and his wife, officials said
the death toll of seven also included another woman who was driving a pilot truck behind the tractor-trailer on the narrow, twisting section of u.s. 93 near this remote western arizona community on monday, authorities said
the children's mother, susan e. stone, 24, of las vegas, was the only occupant of the motor home to survive the crash. she was taken to a hospital in nearby kingman for treatment of shock
stone's husband was driving ahead of the motor home and was not injured, officials said
investigators at the scene found the dead burned beyond recognition, said sgt. allan schmidt of the state department of public safety
jim bell, an engineer for the hualapai fire district, said the glovers and stones were en route from nevada to a family reunion in phoenix
schmidt said investigators determined that the motor home was southbound on u.s. 93 when it apparently swerved off the right side of the highway, over-corrected and came back onto the roadway and struck the trailer portion of the northbound semi-truck
the motor home then hit the pilot pickup truck, pushing the pickup back into a fourth vehicle that was following behind it, said schmidt. the motor home, pickup and the fourth vehicle then burst into flames
schmidt said the driver of the fourth vehicle escaped injury, as did the driver of the tractor-trailer rig
u.s. 93, part of the most direct route between phoenix and las vegas, nev., was not completely reopened to traffic until early today
the six occupants of the motor home who were killed have been identified as omer l. glover, 63; his wife, hazel f. glover, 62; and their grandchildren, elizabeth a. stone, 8; justin m. stone, 5; trevor j. stone, 2; and kyle a. stone, 1 month, all of las vegas, nevada, authorities said
also killed was verda noble, 57, of phoenix, the driver of the pilot truck
students at gallaudet university boycotted classes today to protest the naming of a hearing person as president of the nation's only university for the deaf. some classes were canceled; others were sparsely attended
the boycott was called after the students, who had closed the school monday by blocking entrances to the campus, were told by police that they would be arrested if they refused to open the gates
we're going to boycott until we get what we want _ a deaf president,'' said tim rarus, a student protest leader
several faculty members supported the students, including the chairman of the school's mathematics department, herbert mapes, who stayed away from his scheduled classes
i'm behind the students 100 percent,'' he told a reporter
about 250 of the students, instructors and administrators boycotting normal school activities crowded into a campus auditorium to reiterate their demand that a deaf president be named
but the woman whose appointment as gallaudet's president triggered the demonstrations said today she had no intention of rejecting the offer
i'm committed to taking the job and i'm committed to the university,'' elizabeth ann zinser said on ``cbs this morning.''
asked about the continuing protests, she said:
i believe we can overcome that conflict, but i understand and can appreciate the sentiments of some of the students and friends of the university at this time learning that their seventh president is not deaf.''
students had blocked entrances to the university monday but changed tactics late monday after police told them their cars would be ticketed and towed, and any protesters interfering would be arrested, according to rarus
the university was officially open today, but administration officials said no policy had been set on whether students would be penalized for boycotting classes
class attendance policies are determined on an individual basis,'' said provost catherine ingold. ``it will be up to each teacher to decide whether to do anything.''
zinser, an administrator at the university of north carolina at greensboro, was selected over two deaf finalists. after her appointment as president of the nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf, hundreds of chanting students marched through downtown washington, with stops at the white house and the capitol, to protest the decision
monday, students swarmed at the gates of the campus before dawn and refused to let professors and administrators in, forcing officials to cancel classes for the day. in the afternoon, about 1,800 of the school's 2,200 students again protested at the capitol
trustees including board chairwoman jane bassett spilman met with a group of students, faculty and staff for three hours monday, but emerged from the meeting sticking by their original decision to hire zinser
students had demanded the replacement of zinser with a deaf leader, spilman's resignation, and moves to make deaf persons a majority on the school's 20-member board of trustees. the board now has only four deaf members
spilman told a gathering of about 2,000 students that the board's decision had followed a ``careful, reasoned'' search process
a lawful, proper and final decision was made,'' spilman said. she left a short while later without taking questions from reporters
zinser, who does not speak sign language but has promised to learn, said in a telephone interview from greensboro that she understands the students' desire for a deaf president but that she believes they will eventually come to accept her. she also said she will maintain some ``distance'' from the school until emotions subside
covell said students are concentrating their protests on capitol hill, because gallaudet, created by an act of congress in 1864, receives most of its operating budget from the federal government. in fiscal 1988, gallaudet is receiving $62 million from congress
we're trying to put some pressure on congress, to get them to put some pressure on our board,'' said covell
she doesn't even sign. what does that tell you?'' said student dean prentice, 21, of garden city, kan. ``we need a deaf person as a role model.''
five youngsters were arrested for allegedly stealing dozens of stuffed cats and peddling them in a shopping center parking lot
police believe the five children, aged 10 to 13, stole dozens of garfield the cat dolls from a store sunday. the youths were spotted outside a shopping center selling the $20 dolls for $2 to $3, police said
in recent months, there have been numerous reports of garfield thefts, mostly from car windows, where the doll's paws are attached with suction cups
it's some kind of fad,'' said lt. rico castro of the san fernando police department. ``but i don't get it. it seems pretty silly.''
los angeles police detective robert uber said police were called to the panorama mall on sunday after security guards detained the boys. the guards had watched them sell the dolls and then enter a department store, where they tried to take $171 worth of clothing, uber said
the boys were placed in the custody of juvenile authorities
last month, three teen-agers were arrested in north hollywood for 30 similar thefts. police said those suspects had stolen the dolls for their girlfriends
meanwhile, a garfield belonging to los angeles county deputy district attorney pamela davis-springer was cat-napped monday from her pickup truck. unrest</head>
weeping armenians gathered in a snowy cemetery in moscow on tuesday to exchange tales of brutal beatings and deaths in a southern city torn by ethnic mob violence
their accounts, which often elicited cries of anger from the 300 listeners, could not be verified independently, but were typical of stories that have been circulating in armenian communities since the feb. 28 rioting in the city of sumgait in the republic of azerbaijan
the unrest in sumgait was triggered by protests in the republic of armenia demanding that a region given to neighboring azerbaijan in 1923 be shifted to armenian control. the population of the nagorno-karabakh district is more than three-quarters armenian
tass, the official soviet news agency, has said that 31 people were killed in sumgait, which has an armenian minority. soviet officials have refused to elaborate on what happened and moscow-based journalists have been barred from traveling to the caucasus region
there have been many reports by armenian activists of high death tolls and brutality against armenians by azeris, members of the dominant ethnic group in azerbaijan. the azeris are predominantly shiite moslem, while the armenians are predominantly christian
the tearful crowd gathered in front of a brick church in the armenian section of moscow's vagankovskoye cemetery. plainclothes police watched but did not try to break up the meeting, which lasted two hours
one distraught man said he saw a pregnant woman and her unborn baby slain and mutilated in sumgait. at the local communist party headquarters, he said, he saw people who were covered with knife wounds and who had their ears cut off
the gray-haired man left without giving his name
the meeting began with a moment of silence for women slain in sumgait. a priest clad in black asked members of the crowd who had witnessed anti-armenian violence to come forward to speak
a resident of a village near sumgait said bands of azeris had roved through his settlement, looking under beds for armenian children and raping armenian women. another armenian said young children had been thrown from windows
ambartsum galestyan, deputy chairman of the committee that organized last month's protests in yerevan, armenia's capital, said 33 people had been killed in the sumgait rioting
they included two azeris, galestyan said. he said the azeris had been killed by military units brought in to restore order, and that eight soldiers had been killed. he said 100 to 150 people were seriously injured
galestyan said 4- and 5-year-old children had been thrown out of fifth-floor windows by mobs in sumgait, an industrial city of more than 160,000 people. the yerevan resident did not say how he had learned of the attacks on the children or whether they had been killed, and it was not clear whether he had been in sumgait
a villager who lives near sumgait said four people in his settlement were slain. the villager, who did not give his name, said he did not know where his family or sister were. ``i fear for their safety,'' he told the meeting
some speakers were angry at soviet state-run press and television, which blamed ``extremists'' for the dispute over nagorno-karabakh and never clearly linked the violence in sumgait to antagonisms between armenians and azeris
how can the soviet media today be silent, under conditions of openness and restructuring?'' asked robert aryanpetyan, a specialist in history who lives in moscow. ``shame on the central television.''
john zaccaro jr., who was arrested on drug charges about a year after his mother's vice presidential bid, says working with runaways has shown him that everyone deserves a second chance
i've learned that everyone deserves a second chance, or a third and fourth chance, however many it may take,'' zaccaro, son of geraldine ferraro, wrote in the march 29 issue of woman's day magazine about his volunteer work with covenant house
my problems are nothing compared to the kids i see on the streets; when i ran into trouble, my family was there,'' said zaccaro, 23, who was arrested for sale and possession of drugs in february 1984, while a student at middlebury college in vermont. the case is still pending
zaccaro said two other colleges refused to admit him because of the drug charge and he couldn't get a job
my mom, who had helped so many college kids get jobs, was devastated by her inability to help me. `they don't want the notoriety of john zaccaro working for them,' she told me.'''
so he volunteered at covenant house, riding around in a van all night to offer food, emotional support and other help to teen-age runaways, many of them involved in drugs and prostitution
i'm just john, a friendly face in a blue van. many of these kids pick up newspapers out of the trash cans. if they read the stories about me and my family, they don't make the connection. and i'm glad of that,'' he wrote
i'm proud of my family _ my mom for taking on a tough fight and my dad, well, for going through a lot of grief in a gentle way that gives me a lot to imitate.''
when james l. galliher was called for jury duty, he had an excuse that was hard to refuse

a navy effort to upgrade future los angeles-class attack submarines has generated delays at production shipyards and contract overruns totaling $1.3 billion, the service said tuesday
the estimated $1.3 billion overrun covers 23 of the attack subs scheduled for delivery into the 1990s and amounts to roughly a 5.9 percent increase over the negotiated target price for each submarine, the navy said
the navy's target price for each of the attack submarines currently is between $750 million and $760 million. of the 23 submarines covered by the latest overrun estimate, 11 are being built by general dynamics corp. and 12 by newport news shipbuilding &amp; drydock co
under the production contracts covering the vessels, the overrun will be split 50-50 with each of two shipyards building the subs, meaning the navy will have to pay out roughly $650 million beyond the target price of the 23 submarines
the navy said it already had the funds on hand to pay the overrun, however, because it had anticipated there might be some delays associated with improving the los angeles-class of subs
the navy has retained funds to cover all improvements, and there are no plans to seek additional funds from congress to cover these improvements,'' the service added
the delivery delays vary by shipyard, but range from seven months to 18 months, the navy said
the los angeles class, also known as the 688 class, is the navy's primary attack sub. the nuclear-powered vessel is designed to hunt and destroy soviet submarines and is built at general dynamics' electric boat division in groton, conn., and at the newport news shipyard in newport news, va
the navy is now in the midst of research and development work on a new attack submarine, designated the ssn-21 seawolf, but doesn't anticipate that vessel materializing before 1994 at the earliest
in the interim, the navy set out to improve the 688-class submarine with such things as a stronger hull to allow arctic operations; better electronic and sensor systems; a series of noise-reduction modifications; and installation of launching boxes for tomahawk cruise missiles
the service said tuesday some of the improvements had required extensive modification of the original design, leading to delays that were not totally unexpected
in this case, the navy and contractors have at least agreed up front on how cost overruns will be handled and thus should avoid the type of legal wrangling that erupted after cost overruns skyrocketed on the same submarine in the 1970s, said assistant navy secretary everett pyatt
i'm not going through that again,'' pyatt added
four newport news boats are now expected to be delivered from 14 months to 18 months late, while seven general dynamics' submarines will be delivered from seven months to nine months late
we want the deliveries on as timely a basis as possible, but we have to acknowledge the fact that the modifications which we asked for were a contributing factor,'' dan howard, the pentagon's chief spokesman, said tuesday
jed christensen, director of the office of surface mining, will leave the job march 20 for a county job in california, the office said today
chistensen, who worked in local government in utah, nevada, california and arizona before joining the interior department in 1981, will become deputy chief executive of fresno county
he has been director or acting director of the federal government's chief regulatory body for strip mines since april 1985, longer than anyone else in the history of the 10-year-old agency
during his tenure, the office returned to state jurisdiction parts of the oklahoma regulatory program it had taken over in 1984, installed a computer system to match applicants for mining permits against operators with outstanding violations and won congressional abolition of an exemption from regulation of mines covering less than two acres. voting; dole comment and turnout information from arkansas; pick up pvs bgng ``the person...</note>
republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis, favored in the busiest primary day ever, cast their ballots today in super tuesday elections designed to give a southern cast to the presidential race. with strong support throughout dixie, democrat jesse jackson made a last-minute appeal to minority voters
it was the biggest day in the history of presidential primaries, one that could virtually settle the republican race and give a clearer focus to the crowded democratic contest
five candidates were among the voters
if we exceed our expectations of live up to them, i think we'll be in good shape,'' said bush as he arrived at his polling place in houston
gop rival bob dole told reporters in missouri that ``it's going to be a little tougher as we go along, but i've been in tough fights before.''
dukakis voted in the brookline section of boston and denounced as ``garbage'' television ads run this weekend by sen. albert gore jr. of tennessee. the ads said he let massachusetts lose manufacturing jobs at a rate eight times the national average and that his foreign policy views had been described as ``mushy.''
jackson made one last pitch to black voters in alabama and hispanic voters in texas in his bid to translate dixie appeal into delegates
republican pat robertson was carrying david and goliath dolls when he arrived to vote in virginia beach, va., and said they symbolized his contest against bush
i am the conservative candidate and i will be the conservative candidate all the way to new orleans,'' he said, referring to the site of the republican national convention
gore and his wife, tipper, voted in carthage, tenn., and the candidate said, ``i think we've got the momentum. i think we're going to have a good day.''
rep. richard gephardt of missouri voted by absentee ballot
voters began to make their choices in 14 southern and border states and in seven other locales as far afield as hawaii and american samoa. early reports on voter turnout ranged from light to moderate in many southern states to projections of a record turnout in texas. ``it's just a steady stream,'' said vernon tigner, the democratic judge at cross creek 22 in north carolina
it was raining in arkansas and elections officials reported a light turnout except in black areas where it was heavy
we are having a pretty heavy turnout,'' said janice mcclelland, a worker at a predominantly black precinct in crittenden county
bush sounded confident of a solid delegate boost toward the republican nomination. dole had already returned to the midwest, flying to illinois which holds its primary next tuesday
the person that clearly wins super tuesday is going to be the nominee of the party and i think the next president,'' bush told reporters in tulsa on monday
dole also was in oklahoma and while conceding bush was likely to carry most super tuesday states, said, ``we don't want to lose the white house by nominating the wrong person.''
an abc news poll of voters in super tuesday states said bush was leading in 16 of the 17 states holding republican contests. dole was ahead only in missouri
abc news said it interviewed a total of 8,659 voters across the region between march 3 and 6 for the survey, but cautioned that its samples in the non-southern states were too small to produce specific numbers for the candidates. it said the margin of error for the southern results was 3 percentage points either way
the survey indicated that not only that bush was leading throughout the south, but that his strongest leads were in the two biggest states _ texas with 111 delegates and florida with 82
among the democrats, dukakis had a lock on his home state of massachusetts and rhode island and was leading in florida, maryland and by a narrow margin in texas
jackson was the leader in deep south states such as alabama, georgia, mississippi and louisiana, as well as arkansas, north carolina and virginia where blacks comprise up to 30 percent of the democratic electorate
hands that once picked cotton tomorrow morning will pick a president,'' jackson told an exuberant crowd at a rally in birmingham, ala. on monday night
gore, banking on his southern heritage and longest time spent capaigning the region, was leading in kentucky, oklahoma and tennessee, according to the survey
gephardt, counting on winning support with a populist appeal, was said to be leading only in his home state
a new poll published today in the atlanta journal-constitution also gave bush a wide lead in the south, finding him favored by 56 percent of republicans surveyed in 12 states in the region. on the democratic side, jackson led with 29 percent support, followed by dukakis and gore with 20 percent each
for robertson, the southern primaries amounted to his last, best chance to demonstrate that he could mount a serious challenge to the establishment candidates. despite a strong following among evangelical christians, the former television preacher has yet to win a gop primary and was a disappointing third in south carolina on saturday, a state he once boasted he would win ecisively
bush has me four to one,'' robertson said monday in charlotte, n.c. ``i'm like david up against goliath. but we will do very well in the south.''
rep. jack kemp of new york was given no chance of carrying a super tuesday state and planned to meet with advisers on wednesday and was presumed to be ready to drop out of the race
on the democratic side, sen. paul simon of illinois made no effort in the super tuesday states and planned to resume his candidacy in his home state
gary hart trudged on, attracting little notice and even less support
holding republican and democratic primaries were alabama, arkansas, florida, georgia, kentucky, louisiana, maryland, massachusetts, mississippi, missouri, north carolina, oklahoma, rhode island, tennessee, texas and virginia. in addition, democrats in american samoa, hawaii, idaho and nevada were holding caucuses as were both parties in washington
democrats in minnesota, constrained by national party rules from allocating delegates from their caucuses held two weeks ago, were doing so tonight
dukakis was the big winner in minnesota, but jackson and simon also were expected to pick up delegates
the states holding republican primaries were selecting 712 delegates, more than two-thirds of the 1,139 needed for a convention majority
on the democratic side, the prize was 1,307 delegates. a total of 2,082 were needed for the nomination
the latest associated press delegate count gave bush 126, dole 65, kemp 35 and robertson 8. for the democrats the count was dukakis 69, gephardt 50, gore 21, jackson 27, simon 35, hart 0, and uncommitted 258
during a campaign flight in missouri, bush told reporters he wouldn't predict a sweep. ``it's too much for anyone to expect,'' he said. caucuses</head>
a federal judge today refused to issue a restraining order that would have allowed civilian workers at a navy shipyard to participate in washington's presidential precinct caucuses tonight
the navy earlier had said that the federal hatch act prevented 11,600 workers at the puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton from speaking out on which candidates they preferred
u.s. district judge jack tanner's brief order said the state of washington, which had asked for the restraining order, failed to show irreparable injury would result if the navy's position were allowed to stand and ``failed to establish the balance of hardships tip in their favor.''
tanner's ruling came in a hastily filed state suit, which contended that prohibiting federal workers from speaking at the party caucuses unconstitutionally violated their right to free speech
the suit, filed monday, asked tanner to clarify the intent of the hatch act by interpreting ``conflicting sections'' of the regulations, said david bryant, a spokesman for the washington secretary of state's office
secretary of state ralph munro was miffed at the ruling and said the state may pursue the case for future years
i'm disappointed he didn't provide federal workers more protection,'' he said. ``i can't believe in the long run that this is constitutional.''
he said the state's abortive attempt at gaining an injunction did succeed in clarifying that federal workers may attend their caucuses and participate in most respects
it sends a clear signal they can go to the caucuses and do everything but speak out on the canidates,'' munro said. ``it's absurd. a guy can say `what america needs is a senator from kansas who was wounded and was a war hero,' but he can't say, `what america needs is bob dole.'''
a bill to revise the hatch act and allow workers to participate in partisan political activities on their own time overwhelmingly passed the u.s. house last year. it is pending in the senate
officials at the bremerton shipyard had told workers they could attend the political caucuses scheduled in 12,000 washington neighborhoods, but could not discuss candidates
the caucuses are the first step in the months-long process leading up to a selection of delegates from washington to the national presidential nominating conventions this summer. at stake ultimately are 73 democratic national convention delegates and 41 republican delegates
the hatch act states that federal employees may not use their official authority or influence to interfere with an election
obviously, addressing the caucus is part of the activity,'' said james sommerhauser, representing professional and technical engineers local 12 in bremerton, but ``most federal employees are so intimidated by the hatch act they're afraid to participate.''
sommerhauser said his union represents 1,800 federal workers at the yard and elsewhere in the county
water, food and bugs were not to blame for a mysterious outbreak that sent 91 students to hospitals, officials said tuesday
ninety of the 91 students from rincon junior high school were back in school tuesday, a day after they were treated for rashes, swollen eyes, blisters, stomach cramps or breathing difficulties following physical education classes, said diane ho, a spokeswoman for the rowland unified school district
soil samples were to be taken tuesday, and physicians were to interview the students, ms. ho said. ``hopefully we will find out something and solve this mystery.''
school district officials believe the students came in contact with the contaminant on the playground monday morning. but experts called in by the district have ruled out water, herbicides, bugs, grass and school-prepared food, ms. ho said
no adults experienced any symptoms, ms. ho said. one student, who has asthma, remained overnight in a hospital, she said. but some students were given medication. e principe</head>
a lisbon radio station said today authorities in the west african island nation of sao tome e principe crushed a coup attempt, killing two people
a correspondent reporting from the former portuguese colony for lisbon's radio commercial said 40 armed men landed by canoe before dawn today and tried to seize the police headquarters near the capital of sao tome
the report said forces loyal to the government of president manuel pinto da costa killed two of the attackers and captured the others
the radio correspondent, jaime marques de almeida, said the government blamed the coup attempt on the national resistence front of sao tome e principe that has its headquarters in libreville, gabon. he said the government was expected to make an official statement on the reported coup attempt later
the lisbon-based secretary-general of the national resistence front, quintiliano loures amado, denied the group was responsible
fundamentalist moslem students attacked a group of scouts with knives, stones and bicycle chains, then opened fire on security forces as they came to the scouts' aid, authorities said tuesday
two policemen and two extremists were wounded slightly, said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity
he said officers arrested about 50 students after the monday night incident and another 20 on tuesday. many had been arrested after a demonstration late last year
the fundamentalists apparently attacked the male and female scouts because of their belief that the sexes should not mix
police said the fundamentalist students were found with two empty pistols, iron rods, knives and daggers. about 25 shell casings from rounds used against security forces were found at the stadium on the assiut university campus where the violence occurred
on tuesday, police clamped tight security on the downtown courthouse where the suspects were housed. on campus, about 500 fundamentalists tried to demonstrate for the release of their classmates but were stopped by university guards, security officials said
street demonstrations are banned in egypt under an emergency law enacted after moslem extremists assassinated president anwar sadat in october 1981
for several years, the university campus has been a hotbed of moslem fundamentalist agitation in assiut, a southern nile town 235 miles south of cairo
monday night's trouble began during a meeting and parade of the rovers, the equivalent of the explorers in the american boy scout program
university officials said militants attacked the parade
university guards were unable to contain the fight and called for help from outside security police, normally banned from the campus
four people were hurt in the melee that followed, but the rovers escaped unhurt by climbing out stadium windows and clambering down fire escapes, security officials said
in a telephone call to the associated press in cairo, a man claiming to speak for assiut's fundamentalists blamed security police for the trouble. he said his group demonstrated because the university administration had ``organized a dancing and singing party,'' and security police broke up the demonstration with tear gas and batons
security officials said the suspects were charged with firearms and other weapons offenses and destroying musical instruments
the fundamentalists appear to have been angered because they believe the sexes should be forbidden from mixing in parties, picnics or other social events
sen. albert gore jr.'s southern strategy faced a do-or-die test on super tuesday. democratic rivals michael dukakis and jesse jackson were favored overall in the battle for 1,307 party delegates and richard gephardt fought for survival
jackson, a black man born and educated in the south, relied on his wide support among that region's large black population and figured to be among the delegate leaders in the super tuesday voting
gov. dukakis of massachusetts was virtually conceded the support of his home state, and he sought to win on both sides of dixie with strong bids in texas and florida
gore of tennessee and gephardt of missouri were heavily favored to win their home states. they battled among themselves for what was left of the white vote. theirs was a struggle for survival, with each reduced to a strategy aimed at emerging as the white alternative to dukakis when the campaign moves elsewhere
two other candidates were on the ballot but weren't factors: sen. paul simon of illinois and gary hart, the former senator from colorado
twenty states and american samoa were holding democratic contests in what was the closest thing to a national primary ever held
most were in the south, where every state save south carolina had a primary. south carolina democrats select delegates saturday
outside the south, there were primaries in massachusetts, rhode island, washington state, idaho and nevada
at stake were 1,307 delegates _ more than half the number needed to win the nomination. a candidate had to receive at least 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to win delegates
jackson is from the only southern state not voting, south carolina. but he had a strong appeal to blacks, who make up a quarter of the democratic vote in the south _ and as much as half in alabama and mississippi
with so many white candidates fragmenting the vote, jackson hoped to score well in other southern states, too
after wins in new hampshire, maine and vermont, dukakis hoped to demonstrate an appeal to democrats outside new england, and he concentrated heavily on texas and florida. he had wide appeal among jewish voters in south florida and hispanics in texas
gore followed a southern strategy that ignored the earliest contests, even while insisting he was a national candidate. but he faced a severe battle even to emerge as his own region's candidate
gephardt entered the southern campaign with little money to mount the heavy television campaign that succeeded for him in the earlier states. he and gore sought the moderate and conservative vote
simon, running as the clear liberal, was reeling and broke from third-place finishes in iowa and new hampshire. he sat out the super tuesday campaign and awaited the next stop, his home state of illinois where he planned a low-budget campaign to get back in the race
hart, a year ago the odds-on favorite, acknowledged before super tuesday that he didn't expect to be the nominee but was pressing his candidacy in an effort to steer the campaign debate
hart had re-entered the race in december but couldn't regain the support he had before dropping out seven months earlier amid disclosures about his relationship with model donna rice
seven women have been attacked in the last month by the ``center city stalker,'' who forces them into secluded areas of downtown buildings, robs them, ties them up and sometimes rapes them, police said
the stalker strikes day or night, with the latest attack at 8 a.m. monday in the lobby of a downtown building, say police, who speculate he may be a security guard because he showed a badge to one victim
police commissioner kevin tucker has formed a special 24-hour task force
my dad will pick me up from work every day this week until they catch that animal,'' said diane mills, a federal express employee said
police have distributed composite drawings to office buildings and businesses, and federal express couriers dropped off copies of a police sketch as they made deliveries tuesday
monday night, police swarmed the streets after the latest victim gave a description that matched ones from victims in four of the other six cases
the 20-year-old woman was on her way to a class near city hall when she was grabbed near an elevator, police said. the man dragged her at gunpoint into a secluded spot, robbed her of two gold chains and a diamond-studded gold watch
one man has been arrested and charged with robbery and attempted rape in another case. but none of the seven stalker victims could identify him in a lineup, police said
the reagan administration on tuesday joined a group of senators in urging the south african government to release zwalakhe sisulu, a prominent black journalist detained for the past 14 months without trial
we see no justification for mr. sisulu's detention,'' state department spokesman charles redman said. ``he has been a leader in efforts to resolve south africa's political problems peacefully.''
he's the type of black leader the south african government should be talking to, not repressing,'' redman added
redman said u.s. ambassador edward j. perkins made a personal appeal to the south african authorities for sisulu's release and ``we will continue to urge'' his freedom
a group of 52 senators has written south african president p.w. botha on sisulu's behalf. the letter was made public monday
a bus carrying american tourists on a trip through the holy land skidded on a rain-slick highway east of the occupied gaza strip and flipped over tuesday, injuring all 56 people on board, officials said
three of the 55 americans were in serious condition and the bus driver also was hurt. the passengers, en route from israel to egypt, crawled from the overturned bus through shattered windows
i was climbing over bodies. blood was just running all over,'' said dora bowling, a retired secretary from fairmont, w.va
the americans were participating in an extensive tour of the holy land sponsored by the united methodist church's west virginia conference
tour coordinator wendall eskew identified the three seriously injured passengers as margaret glass of dunbar, w.va.; mary lou moore, of charleston, w.va.; and donna light of wheeling, w.va
he said glass and moore are in their 70s and light is in her 50s
five other people were in moderate condition at barzilai hospital in ashkelon, 15 suffered minor injuries and the others were treated and released, said ilana zeev, a spokeswoman for the facility, 40 miles southeast of jerusalem
we were going around a curve and it was raining and slick and the bus seemed to hydroplane,'' said bonny eskew, a piano and organ teacher from charleston, w.va
we were heading for a ditch, then we swerved back to the right, lost control and turned over,'' said mrs. eskew, 59, who had a badly bruised right eye. ``it happened so fast we didn't have time to do anything.''
passengers spoke at jerusalem's hyatt hotel, where they returned after being treated at the ashkelon hospital
many of the americans suffered fractured limbs, including broken hands, wrists and shoulder bones, or cuts requiring stitches, said an emergency room surgeon who spoke on condition of anonymity
police commander ezra menashe told israel army radio the accident involved a bus from the east jerusalem tourism co. and occurred on the road between miflasim and kfar azza, two collective farms located about three miles east of the gaza strip
the tourists were headed from jerusalem to cairo via the egyptian border crossing at rafah on the southern tip of the gaza strip. the bus departed from the northern city of tiberias
debbie mcgraw, a church secretary in charleston, said the bus was carrying lay people and clergy from various parts of the state, as well as relatives from virginia and possibly other states, mcgraw said
she said the bus passengers were part of a larger tour and had opted to extend the tour and visit egypt. she said tour members on the bus were scheduled to return friday and saturday
those on the bus had ``successfully completed a holy land pilgrimage and were on the way to egypt for a three-day tour extension,'' said richard ridgeway, vice president of educational opportunities inc. of lakeland, fla., the tour operator
china's foreign minister told president reagan today his government is very concerned about the iran-iraq war and supports an arms embargo against the tehran regime, a white house spokesman said
president spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration also accepts china's declaration that it no longer is selling silkworm missiles to iran, although it remains a supplier of conventional arms
reagan met for nearly 40 minutes in the oval office with wu xueqian, who was making his first visit to the united states in four years. posing for photographers, reagan said, ``we have a very cordial relationship between our two countries and we want to continue it.''
briefing reporters on the meeting, fitzwater said wu offered support for a u.n. cease-fire resolution in the iran-iraq war, and also endorsed an arms embargo to back it up ``if the overwhelming majority of the (u.n.) security council believed it should be adopted.''
fitzwater said the administration did not believe that wu was trying to qualify or limit his endorsement
it was our reaction, the president's reaction, that this was a very positive sign, a very strong expression of support and one, frankly, one we hope the soviet union would emulate,'' fitzwater said
in the talks, reagan did not bring up the subject of the silkworm missiles, although it was discussed in wu's earlier meetings with secretary of state george p. shultz, fitzwater said
the united states protested to china last fall about its sale of silkworms to iran. ``to the best of our information, they have not delivered any missiles since then,'' fitzwater said
while noting that china still remains a major supplier of conventional arms, he said, ``we think the fact that we have not detected any new missile shipments and their general attitude toward the iran-iraq war and the u.n. resolution _ that those are very hopeful signs.''
wu met monday with shultz and with defense secretary frank c. carlucci
during toasts following a state department luncheon on monday, shultz and wu hailed the progress in bilateal relations and made almost no reference to issues dividing them
chief among those issues is china's reported sales of military weaponry to iran in defiance of u.s. efforts at the united nations to win support for a worldwide arms embargo against iran
the administration has been seeking assurances from china that it will not veto an embargo resolution
last october, the united states retaliated against china for selling silkworm anti-ship missiles to iran by suspending the process under which china had been given increasing access to u.s. products with advanced technology
since then, china has said it has stopped selling silkworms to iran
shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent anti-chinese rioting in tibet. state department spokesman charles redman said between three and nine people are believed to have been killed, and he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in tibet
a 9-year-old boy on monday accidentally fired a .38-caliber handgun into a seat on a school bus carrying about 45 children, bruising a child's knee, authorities said
the 9-year-old boy was suspended pending investigation, and the 7-year-old boy who was bruised did not require medical attention, authorities said
we believe that the child didn't know what he was doing _ it was just a prank,'' said sandra lindsay, assistant superintendent for instruction
the bus was about a mile from knightsville elementary school, which both children attended, when the gun discharged as the boy was trying to unload it, mrs. lindsay said. she said he got the gun from his parents' home
the bullet went through the bus seat, ricocheted and bounced off the knee of a boy two seats behind. mrs. lindsay said the bullet didn't pierce the boy's pants, but caused a small bruise
the children on the bus were being counseled by school nurses, guidance counselors and principals, and none appeared extremely upset, said bob flowers, transportation director. ``milstead, 49 ...'' ^laserphoto pn1</note>
arizona's ranking lawman said today he decided to cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat but didn't tell evan mecham because the governor was so angry about the probe he ``was not to be reasoned with.''
department of public safety director ralph milstead, in his second day of testimony at mecham's impeachment trial, continued to insist that mecham had obstructed justice by ordering milstead not to cooperate
during his five hours of testimony monday, milstead had portrayed mecham as a frightened, angry leader who told him: ``i don't want you to help the attorney general hang me. don't tell him anything.''
the first-term republican governor is accused of trying to thwart an investigation into whether an associate, lee watkins, threatened last nov. 12 to send former top mecham aide donna carlson on ``a long boat ride'' if she testified before a grand jury investigating mecham's campaign finances. watkins has denied threatening ms. carlson
during continued cross-examination today by defense attorney fred craft, milstead testified that mecham was fully informed about the alleged threat and the involvement of the attorney general's office when he told mecham the attorney general wanted information from dps officers about the matter
milstead said today he did not tell mecham during their telephone conversation that he intended to cooperate with the attorney general despite the governor's order not to
i was in shock from his anger that was directed toward the attorney general,'' milstead said. ``he was not to be reasoned with.''
milstead testified monday that he considered the alleged threat serious because watkins had a criminal record. watkins resigned as state prison construction chief after a past assault conviction was disclosed
milstead, 49, said he phoned mecham on nov. 15 to alert him to the possible death threat. ``i think my words to the governor were, `i don't want you to be blindsided,'' said milstead
milstead said when mecham told him not to cooperate with the attorney general, ``i was in shock over what he was saying, taken aback, speechless.''
craft asked milstead why he had not included his own part of the conversation in a report he wrote on his talk with mecham
because i'm not committing a crime,'' said milstead. ``i'm not obstructing justice.''
when did you conclude that the governor's words constituted a crime?'' asked craft
as i'm hearing them and reflecting on them,'' said milstead, adding it took him ``about two seconds'' after hanging up the phone
craft asked if milstead was surprised that his staff didn't tell him the governor had assigned cabinet member max hawkins, then-head of the department of administration, to investigate the death threat allegation
no, it didn't surprise me,'' said milstead. ``max hawkins is not a law enforcement officer. he's not competent to investigate it. lee watkins works for him, and max hawkins wouldn't be taken seriously anywhere on earth that i know of.''
the senators decided monday to forego hearing from watkins because it meant granting him immunity from prosecution. watkins invoked fifth amendment protection against self incrimination
senators also expressed impatience with craft's long interrogation, which minority leader alan stephens, a democrat, called wearing and repetitious
if that's what they do in a court of law,'' said stephens, ``i'm glad i'm not a lawyer.''
mecham, 63, the first u.s. governor to be impeached in six decades, is not attending his trial and did not comment on milstead's testimony. in january, he testified before a house impeachment committee that he may have told milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general's investigation but that he was not fully informed about the seriousness of the situation
mecham also is charged with concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 in a state funds by loaning it to his car dealership
he faces a a may 17 recall election and a march 22 criminal trial on the campaign loan disclosure allegation. a prosecutor in that case, however, sought monday to have it delayed until april 21 on the ground that pretrial defense maneuvers have left the prosecution too little time to prepare
defense lawyers monday filed a series of motions, including one asking for a dismissal of the charges
judge michael ryan of maricopa county superior court said he would rule wednesday or thursday on the prosecution request but did not indicate when he would rule on the defense motions. democrats</head>
pat robertson's fervent band of supporters waged political warfare against republican regulars in presidential caucuses tuesday, while massachusetts gov. michael dukakis was favored over his democratic rivals
none of the state's 41 gop delegates were directly at stake in the caucus voting, but the former television evangelist hoped to embarrass vice president george bush and kansas sen. bob dole
robertson was given a good shot at winning the state where evangelicals have controlled the party for most of a decade, ramming through anti-abortion, ultraconservative platforms at carefully orchestrated conventions
we're stomping the daylights out of them!'' robertson's state organizer, bruce hawkins, said with a delighted chuckle a few days ago
bush and dole forces, waging conventional campaigns, admitted to high anxiety over the robertson factor, but held out hope the party regulars would get worried enough to go to their neighborhood caucuses
the caucus voting was basically a straw poll, since delegates elected to go on to district-level caucuses are not bound to any candidate
on the democratic side, with 65 delegates at stake, dukakis benefited from endorsements by gov. booth gardner, sen. brock adams, seattle mayor charles royer and other party leaders
jesse jackson and illinois sen. paul simon were fighting it out for second- and third-place finishes and a sizable number of caucus-goers were expected to vote for uncommitted delegates, said state democratic chairwoman karen marchioro
a 48-year-old man who held his 11-month-old daughter at gunpoint for more than five hours was arrested today when police officers crept into his apartment and found him asleep, police said
warren dean brown was arrested without incident after the five-hour standoff, during which police evacuated other residents of brown's apartment building, some of them going down ladders from second-floor windows, said helena police chief bill ware
brown is charged with felony assault and was scheduled for arraignment later today in helena justice court, ware said
brown was arrested about 1 a.m. when police entered the family's apartment. they found brown asleep in the master bedroom with his young daughter, crystal, and a loaded .22-caliber pistol, ware said
the incident began at monday night when police received a call from another resident of the building
ware said brown's wife, 26-year-old kathy brown, had escaped with another daughter, 3-year-old amber, after brown pistol-whipped his wife with the handgun, striking her on the face
the area was secured and the wife ... indicated mr. brown stated he was going to kill the family,'' ware said
mrs. brown was taken by ambulance to st. peter's community hospital, where she was treated and released
police evacuated seven people from two other apartments in the building
of the 35 officers in the helena police department, 20 were at the apartment complex while lewis and clark county sheriff's deputies assisted with other calls in the city
there was no phone in the brown apartment and brown did not respond to a hostage negotiator who spoke through a bullhorn, ware said
police aimed a directional microphone at the apartment, heard no movement inside, and at 1 a.m. sent in three members of the department's ``quick response team,'' who found brown and the child in a bedroom, along with the loaded pistol, the chief said
no shots were fired during the incident and brown offered no resistance when arrested, ware said
he said crystal was returned to her mother, who along with her two daughters is now staying with friends
scott b. chambers, editor of the new castle courier-times for 50 years, has died. he was 80
chambers, who died monday in the henry county memorial hospital, was part owner of the courier-times until the chambers family sold it to nixon newspapers inc. in 1986
scott was a major force for both freedom of the press and in the development and welfare of new castle,'' said wes rowe, publisher of the courier-times
chambers was graduated from indiana university in 1930 and became managing editor of the paper when the chambers family purchased the courier and consolidated it with the times, which the family already owned
when chambers' father, walter s. chambers sr., became ill in the late 1940s, scott chambers became both editor and publisher of the courier-times. delegates</head> add will stand as background throughout the cycle.</note>
george bush bid to take command of the republican presidential race in southern-dominated super tuesday elections that offered a third of all nominating delegates. michael dukakis hoped to show nationwide appeal and emerge as the front-runner in a bruising democratic race
jesse jackson, drawing upon his black political base in dixie, looked to win several states and hundreds of democratic delegates. sen. albert gore jr. tested his southern strategy in a battle with rep. richard gephardt to emerge as the moderate contender in the industrial states to come
pre-election surveys indicated bush could hope for a sweep of the gop contests, with sen. bob dole contesting in just a handful of states. pat robertson and jack kemp seemed out of the running almost everywhere
the campaign was notable for its accusatory tv commercials. the number of convention delegates at stake _ 712 in 17 republican contests and 1,307 in 21 democratic primaries and caucuses _ made super tuesday the busiest day of this or any other presidential nomination campaign
as the day dawned, bush and dukakis were the leaders in the hunt for national convention delegates. democratic delegates from minnesota's feb 23 caucuses were being allocated with most to dukakis, followed by jackson
beforehand, dukakis had 70 delegates, gephardt 50, simon 36, jackson 28 and gore 22. it takes 2,082 delegates to win the democratic nomination
among the republicans, it was bush with 126, dole with 65, kemp with 35 and robertson with 8. it takes 1,139 delegates to win the gop nomination
democratic surveys suggested that dukakis and jackson would each carry at least a handful of states. dukakis had his home state of massachusetts in his pocket, but gore countered with his tennessee and gephardt with missouri
dukakis, having won several new england contests, hoped to demonstrate a broader appeal than any of his rivals with victories in texas, florida, washington, maryland, rhode island and hawaii. jackson was strong all across dixie and gore's hopes seemed to rest on the strength of second-place finishes
dukakis targeted his campaign at ethnic voters, liberals and union workers in pockets across the south, aiming his appeal as well at the huge elderly population in florida
dukakis hoped to use his superior finances and organization to pick up dozens of delegates in states where he didn't expect to win outright. his rivals made the same effort on a smaller scale, knowing they could earn at least one delegate in any congressional district where they received 15 percent of the vote
jackson, who has run well in some states without a large number of black voters, was drawing on his core constituency for the first time this year and hoped to win in georgia, virginia, mississippi, louisiana and alabama, as well as one or two other states
sen. paul simon of illinois bypassed the super tuesday elections to concentrate on the primary next week in his home state. gary hart, the long-ago front-runner, was the invisible man politically
the republican picture was entirely different. bush, whose campaign was in jeopardy before new hampshire voted three weeks ago, was comfortably ahead in pre-election polls in nearly every super tuesday state. he aimed to pile up enough delegates to make his nomination seem inevitable, while dole hoped to snare enough to carry him credibly to next week's primary fight in illinois
robertson, the former television evangelist, bid for second place in a few states and a win in the washington caucuses. kemp, who had dreamed of emerging as a conservative alternative in the race, faced a 17-state shutout and seemed likely to withdraw later in the week
gore was banking everything on a strong showing in his native region. he began with his base in tennessee and hoped to pick up a few hundred delegates even if he finished behind jackson across dixie
gephardt, who won the kick-off iowa caucuses exactly one month ago and followed it up in south dakota, counted on a home state win in missouri

a radical sikh priest freed from jail just three days ago was elected tuesday as chief priest for the golden temple, a post that makes him spokesman and spiritual leader for 25 million sikhs
the council responsible for sikh shrines unanimously picked jasbir singh rode to be the new head of the akal takht, or eternal throne, the seat of sikh authority, united news of india reported
the sprawling golden temple complex in amritsar is sikhism's holiest shrine. the council, the shiromani gurudwara prabandhak committee, met in chandigarh, the capital of punjab state about 150 miles north of new delhi
rode, 34, replaces darshan singh, a moderate who resigned last year
rode was released from jail saturday. he has been in custody since 1985 on federal charges of sedition but was never brought to trial
his release, and that of other sikh priests and militants, is believed linked to a government move to include militants in the political process in punjab, which has been wracked by a sikh separatist insurrection since 1982
on sunday, the government dissolved the punjab state legislature. the legislature had been suspended since may 1987 after an escalation of separatist violence. since then, punjab has been ruled by the federal government
new elections will have to be held in the state, possibly drawing participation by the militants
sikhs form just 2 percent of india's 800 million people but are in a majority in punjab
rode is the nephew of sikh militant leader jarnail singh bhindranwale, who was killed in an army attack on the golden temple in 1984
ten people were killed in punjab on tuesday and monday in violence blamed on sikh militants, police said. this year, more than 400 people have been killed in punjab in attacks blamed on sikh extremists. most of the victims have been hindus or moderate sikhs
both races were marked by accusatory campaign commercials on a scope that was unprecedented for a presidential campaign
dukakis aired a commercial featuring an acrobat doing somersaults as he tried to depict gephardt as a man who flip-flops on the issues. dole ran commercials saying bush had approved arms-for-hostages swaps during the iran-contra affair
thus ended what amounted to a southern regional primary campaign, an idea hatched by democratic officials who wanted to give a moderate-to-conservative contender a boost toward the party's 1988 nomination
the idea was to help nominate a democrat who could run strongly across the south in the general election campaign in the fall _ and bolster the prospects of democratic candidates in local elections
but whatever the theory, the result was a struggle carried out largely through costly television commercials with no particular southern cast. the candidates, trying to campaign in an impossible number of areas simultaneously, often were reduced to staging appearances at airports so they could leave as quickly as possible for the next stop
but the commercials were eye-catching, particularly on the democratic side. voters who didn't see the ads would read about them in the paper or see clips on the television news
gephardt attacked dukakis for raising taxes while governor of massachusetts and mocked dukakis for once suggesting that farmers diversify their crops by growing belgian endive. he also aired a spot seeking to portray dukakis' campaign as guilty of a string of dirty tricks
dukakis returned fire with ads featuring an acrobat doing somersaults, while the announcer attacked gephardt as flipflopping on critical issues
gore retooled his message in mid-campaign with a populist appeal designed to siphon off some of gephardt's support. his final flurry of ads attacked gephardt and dukakis. in one commercial he even added a mild jab at jackson
as much as anything, super tuesday was a test of gore's southern strategy for gaining the nomination. alone among the contenders, he ignored the iowa caucuses and spent months collecting endorsements and campaigning in his native region in hopes of jump-starting his campaign at home after others had left the field. however, among the original democratic candidates, only bruce babbitt was gone by super tuesday
the democratic idea for a regional primary suited the bush forces fine. the vice president's aides quickly spread the word that they had erected a ``southern fire wall'' that would contain any damage resulting from defeats in earlier contests. and when bush finished a poor third in the feb 8 iowa caucuses, it looked like the theory would get a test
but then came bush's victory in new hampshire's primary, followed by his convincing triumph in the south carolina primary on saturday
and instead of merely hoping to hold his own, the vice president spent the last two days campaigning and advertising heavily in dole's strongest state in missouri in hopes of pulling off a sweep
dole suffered through a difficult period as his campaign manager fired two senior aides in an internal struggle for control
even as the polls opened on super tuesday, the contenders were looking ahead to the next round in the nominating wars
dole had begun airing television commercials in illinois, a contest his aides said he had to win to sustain his candidacy
the average college administrator got a 3.3 percent pay increase this year, down from 5.3 percent a year ago, the college and university personnel association said tuesday
the 3.3 percent increase for 1987-88 was less than the 3.7 percent increase in consumer prices during the same period, and the first time since 1982-83 that the college salaries trailed the rise in the consumer price index
the association derived the figures from its 11th annual survey of how much colleges pay their presidents, deans and other administrators
college tuitions have been rising faster than consumer prices for most of the 1980s, and campuses have come under increasing pressure from secretary of education william j. bennett and other critics to hold down costs
an air force transport plane crashed shortly after takeoff tuesday, killing 12 people, five of them on the ground, a news agency reported
the plane, which was not further identified, crashed over a four-square-mile area near cuttack, in eastern orissa state, the united news of india reported
in addition to the five villagers killed by debris from the crash, eight others were injured and more than 40 homes and stores were damaged, the news agency said
the plane was bound for new delhi. the air force is investigating the cause of the crash
a senior tibetan communist party official tuesday condemned the ``savage actions'' of his tibetan countrymen who sparked two days of anti-chinese riots in the capital of lhasa last week
sabotage'' of the monk-led rioters ``went completely against the people's wish for a normal democratic life.'' tibet's party deputy secretary raidi was quoted as saying by the official xinhua news agency
xinhua also claimed in a report from lhasa that no policemen carried arms while on duty saturday. western sources have said that five tibetans and three policemen were killed in the rioting, while chinese officials say the only death was that of a policeman
another chinese official report said the riots, which started saturday, stretched into sunday. previous reports said there was no unrest sunday
that report, by the china news agency, also said tibetan monks tried to poison the tea of chinese officials and journalists attending ceremonies to mark the end of a major buddhist festival
xinhua said 309 policemen were injured, 29 seriously, by tibetans attacking with stones, clubs and iron bars. the china news service, monitored in hong kong, put the number of hospitalized police officers at more than 30
there have been unconfirmed reports that some rioters were shot, and western travelers in lhasa, contacted by telephone, have reported seeing large contingents of armed police
travelers said police on tuesday withdrew their blockade from around the jokhang temple, lhasa's main temple and the scene of the violent protest against chinese rule
william tang, assistant foreign manager at the lhasa hotel, said guests were told they could go to the temple's market square but ``at their own risk.''
most tibetans detest and oppose the savage actions of the handful of splittists,'' raidi, a tibetan, told xinhua
splittists is a termed coined by the chinese to describe those who seek independence for regions in china
the weekend violence followed a similar outbreak of pro-independence unrest in early october during which at least 14 people died
chinese troops entered tibet in 1950 after beating nationalist chinese forces in a civil war. nine years later, tibet's spiritual and temporal leader, the dalai lama, fled into exile after an abortive uprising
many tibetans continue to be bitter about china's suppression of local customs and religion and its destruction of temples
china news service accused the monks of being the ringleaders saturday, the final day of a major 10-day festival known as the great prayer festival
the report said monks saturday attacked the vans of chinese tv crews photographing the 500-year-old prayer festival and dropped a 22-pound boulder from a rooftop
seven cars from tibet's local tv station and a camera were smashed, the report said. two cars were turned over and another set afire as the rampaging monks shouted, ``smash anything that is communist!''
a western traveler said tibetans told him police beat two monks to death inside the jokhang temple
several tibetans later carried the monks' bodies around the square, he said, triggering further clashes
the dalai lama, in a statement from his office in new delhi, monday said the violence clearly revealed the ``desperation'' of the tibetan people. he called on tibetans to ``restrain from violence in spite of repressive measures that the chinese may take.''
negotiators on tuesday reported progress in their work on the fine print of an emerging afghan settlement in talks to end nine years of fighting
u.n. mediator diego cordovez told reporters that negotiations were focusing on ``sensitive technicalities'' of the four documents that are to make up the peace package and govern the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 soviet troops backing kabul's communist government
asked if there was substantive progress, he said ``yes'' but did not elaborate. ``even if the two sides wanted to sign the accords now they cannot do so before the agreements are ready,'' he said
cordovez's optimistic comments came as an afghan resistance group quit the seven member anti-soviet alliance because it said the interim government in afghanistan could be dominated by moslem extremists
the abrupt departure of the afghan national liberation front reduces to two the number of moderate parties in the alliance
pakistan is going to bring in a fundamentalist government. it is not good for afghanistan. it will destroy afghanistan,'' said the front's leader, sibghatullah mojaddedi
it was not clear how mojaddedi's move might affect negotiations
cordovez and other sources close to the talks made it clear that nothing spectacular was likely to emerge in the next few days from the indirect negotiations between pakistan and afghanistan
you should go sightseeing for three days,'' he counseled journalists
still, there was considerable behind-the-scenes activity
cordovez and delegates reportedly kept close touch with deputy u.s. secretary of state robert peck and another visitor, ambassador nicolai kozyrev, described as a soviet specialist on afghan affairs
pakistan's chief representative, acting foreign minister zain noorani, was eager to dispel any notions of a standstill
things are moving forward,'' he said. ``don't you see that i am coming here every day?''
a diplomatic source who insisted on anonymity said prospects for a settlement continued to look good in the current round, which started march 2. the source said that no substantive discussions had taken place on the question of an interim government. pakistan wants the formation of a broad-based transitional kabul government to move on a ``second track'' parallel to the implementation of troop withdrawal
it argues that only a generally acceptable government can ensure the safe return of more than five million refugees and prevent more bloodshed in the country already mourning more than one million dead
the kabul delegation has publicly rejected pakistan's request as an attempt to introduce an extraneous issue that could undermine the talks. but pakistan is reported to be still hoping for a compromise, perhaps by agreeing to sign the settlement with the present leadership _ which it does not recognize _ in return for assurances that an interim government will be formed soon afterward
pakistani president muhammad zia ul-haq, in dubai for inauguration of the emirates golf club, said tuesday an interim government was a necessary ingredient in any settlement
we do not want to go over just pages of an agreement. out of the geneva process we want to take a comprehensive settlement. and for that settlement, an interim government is one of the most essential instruments,'' zia said
an afghan resistance group on tuesday quit an anti-soviet alliance because of fears that the interim government in afghanistan will be dominated by moslem extremists
sibghatullah mojaddedi, leader of the moderate afghan national liberation front, also resigned as party chief
the front's abrupt departure reduces to two the number of moderate parties in the alliance
hamed karzai, the party's information director, said mojaddedi's move was to protest plans for a future afghan government worked out by the alliance's moslem extremist members
for us it's is finished,'' karzai said of the alliance
at a news conference, mojaddedi said the ``most important decision about afghanistan'' had been made by seven people _ the leaders of the seven-party alliance
nobody has looked to the 15 million people of afghanistan,'' he said, adding that the three million shiite moslems had particularly been ignored
mojaddedi said the proposal for an interim government announced late last month was too hardline
pakistan is going to bring in a fundamentalist government. it is not good for afghanistan. it will destroy afghanistan,'' mojaddedi said
he said the best alternative was to convene a grand national council, whose membership of about 1,000 would include commanders, scholars, tribal and religious leaders, refugees and afghans living abroad
the council, he said, would decide the future government
moslem extremists in the alliance apparently oppose that plan
the alliance, under pressure from pakistan, announced in late february plans to form a future afghan government headed by an all-guerrilla executive council and 28 ministers, possibly including non-communist officials from the communist government in kabul
while pakistan cautiously endorsed the plan, rumors soon circulated in peshawar that the alliance leaders were split over which parties should wield the most power
pakistan, which is negotating with the kabul government over a withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan, has insisted that the formation of a broad-based interim afghan government is crucial for the safe return of about 5 million afghan refugees from pakistan and iran
meanwhile, the remaining six guerrilla leaders called an emergency meeting to discuss the development. none of them would comment on mojaddedi's move
although mojaddedi personally has considerable political influence, his party, comprised of traditional pathan tribal militias with few outside sources of military or financial support, is not strong
the split comes at a sensitive time for pakistan, which speaks for the guerrillas at u.n.-sponsored peace talks in geneva. race</head>
sen. paul simon, silent in the south, lies in wait for democratic rivals jesse jackson and michael dukakis as the presidential campaign turns north to illinois where sen. bob dole is readying a republican last stand against george bush
jackson hopes to reap delegates and votes in chicago, where he lives, while simon seeks strength from state democratic leaders who encouraged him to keep afloat his fading campaign effort
the home-state candidates face a strong challenge from dukakis, whose well-heeled and well-organized staff has scoured the state since last fall and has slates in all districts. dukakis will likely hammer away at economic themes in a state struggling with plant closings and job losses
rep. richard gephardt is not expected to mount a major campaign in the state. he sees no hope of success, given simon and jackson's built-in strengths and dukakis' substantial effort
i think with muddled results (from super tuesday) and a strong favorite son in paul simon, we're going to look at the state beyond that, and that's michigan,'' said spokesman mark johnson
sen. albert gore jr. of near-neighbor tennessee plans to spend part of the week in illinois, as does former sen. gary hart of colorado,
on the republican side, sen. dole, a kansan who has done well in the midwest and calls illinois ``friendly territory,'' has another shot at farm votes
however, vice president bush is backed by gov. james thompson, 93 of 102 county leaders and other influential state leaders
there are no areas we consider ourselves weak in,'' said ed murnane, deputy campaign director
dole also has a strong state operation, with coordinators in all counties and well-known delegate candidates, said campaign director mark schroeder. dole's organization began shifting forces to illinois even before super tuesday
rep. jack kemp of new york and former television evangelist pat robertson were not expected to be major factors
illinois is a diverse state, with numerous ethnic groups, industrial centers, farms, big cities, small towns, professionals and blue-collar workers
illinois is a microcosm of the nation,'' said samuel gove, a political scientist and director emeritus at the university of illinois' institute of government. ``a candidate who can do well here can do well nationally.''
more than 5.9 million residents are registered to vote in tuesday's primary _ the lowest number for any statewide election since 1982. the race is divided into a non-binding presidential preference, dubbed the ``beauty contest,'' and the selection of delegates pledged to a candidate or uncommitted
because of heavy emphasis on earlier races, the candidates have devoted little time to illinois, where 113 democratic and 82 gop delegates will be chosen tuesday. the remaining 85 will be selected at party meetings
during the next six days, however, candidates will crisscross illinois and burn up the airwaves with their messages. dukakis aides, for example, have said they expect to spend about $500,000 on tv advertising
simon, however, a first-term senator who has served as congressman, state lawmaker and lieutenant governor, doesn't plan any tv advertising here
he shouldn't have to. he's run here his whole life,'' said jerry sinclair, simon's illinois political director. ``we're short of dollars.''
both simon and jackson have made strong showings in recent state polls
simon, who is supported by many party leaders, has denied speculation he stayed in the race so illinois delegates committed to him can attend the national convention
the plan is to concentrate on illinois and then the midwest industrial states, to keep accumulating delegates,'' sinclair said. ``the way it looks now, no one is going to get this thing on the first ballot. if it becomes more and more ... fragmented, why should paul drop out?''
but jack van der slik, political studies professor at sangamon state university in springfield, said, ``his votes are going to be lower than before he bowed out of super tuesday. he's going to look weak. that's going to be the coup de grace.''
jackson, though, expects to do better than his 1984 showing of 21 percent of illinois' vote, said spokesman frank watkins
watkins said jackson has delegate slates in 21 of 22 congressional districts, compared with four in 1984. he said jackson will fare well in chicago, where 56 percent of the voters are black or hispanic, and will expand his white base, as he has in vermont and minnesota
van der slik, however, said, ``i think jesse is much more vulnerable in this state. people have made up their minds about him. he was much more of a fresh face in a lot of those other situations.''
city supervisors have agreed to ban the sale of realistic toy guns following the recent fatal shooting of a retarded boy who drew a toy pistol on police officers
the measure was proposed by supervisor wendy nelder, daughter of a former police chief, who said some toy stores already have removed toy weapons from their shelves
nobody wants to be responsible for a little kid's death, or a police officer's death, or anybody else's,'' she said in an interview
on feb. 17, two police officers killed silivelio ``tony'' grohse, 13, when he pointed a toy gun, which the officers thought was real, at them during a confrontation
the district attorney's office cleared the officers of wrongdoing, saying they had a ``well-founded fear for their lives.''
in another incident on dec. 21, 1986, a police officer shot a 15-year-old burglary suspect to death after the youth held up a toy gun
toy guns already are banned in los angeles and neighboring burbank and santa monica
nelder's plan won unanimous tentative approval late monday night. final adoption usually is a rubber-stamping procedure taking place within 30 days
under the plan, possession of a toy gun would still be legal. otherwise, she notes, it would be possible for a police officer to arrest people in one house for having toy guns, but impossible to arrest a neighbor with real weapons that were otherwise legal
it also will be legal to sell toy guns that were obviously toys. but, nelder said, ``they'd have to be about four feet long and made of pink plastic, because that's about all nowadays that makes something a toy gun.''
many toymakers already are changing designs as the result of pressure from retailers like toys r us, which has urged manufacturers to come up with ways to keep toy guns from being mistaken for authentic guns, said douglas thomsom, president of the new york-based trade group toys manufacturers of america
to celebrate his 50th birthday march 17, rudolf nureyev will dance the romantic role of albert in the classic ballet ``giselle.''
the paris opera ballet said tuesday that nureyev, director of the paris company, was invited to dance in three performances with the american ballet theatre during its tour to los angeles. the invitation was made by abt director and ballet star mikhail baryshnikov, who, like nureyev, defected from the soviet union
most dancers in nureyev's troupe retire at age 45, but while he makes only rare stage appearances, the elder statesman of classical dance has yet to hang up his slippers
mayor bernie simon said he was delighted with a caricature of himself that is the new ``face on the barroom floor'' at the omaha press club
i'm flabbergasted. i thought i'd look like hell,'' said simon, who has been undergoing radiation therapy for brain tumors. about 125 people attended the unveiling of his portrait monday
the drawing by jim horan shows simon placing toy building blocks along the city's riverfront, where conagra inc. is planning to build a multimillion-dollar headquarters and research center
simon's picture will be displayed in a frame on press club floor for about three months and then will hang in the club's gallery of more than 30 politicians, athletes and business people
cbs inc. founder and chairman william paley made a remarkable recovery from emergency gall bladder surgery and went home tuesday, a spokeswoman said
paley, 86, was in critical condition following his feb. 11 surgery at new york hospital-cornell medical center
hospital spokeswoman myrna manners said paley had ``remarkably improved after one month in the hospital.''
paley bought the columbia broadcasting system, a fledgling radio network, in 1928. he turned over the reins in 1983. but when cbs's biggest stockholder, loew's corp., became unhappy with his successor's policies, paley teamed with loew chairman lawrence tisch to retake control in 1986
tami erin, the 13-year-old star of ``pippi longstocking,'' says she was very excited to see the premiere of her movie accompanied by a japanese princess
it was so weird seeing myself on the big screen,'' miss erin said tuesday after the world premiere of the film based on the popular tomboy of astrid lindgren's novels. ``it was great and i was very excited.''
japan's princess nori, the 18-year-old granddaughter of emperor hirohito, joined miss erin for the first showing of the film, directed by ken annakin
the princess ``was a very sweet girl and very friendly,'' miss erin said. ``she loved it (the movie) a lot.''
the eighth-grader from shark river island, n.j., who began performing in commercials in 1983, was chosen from 9,000 aspirants to play pippi, whose stories have been translated into 44 languages
the movie will be released in the united states in july
two british weeklies have accused prince andrew's wife, the former sarah ferguson, of brash and vulgar behavior during the couple's recent visit to california
london's sunday times said that after seeing the duke and duchess of york, americans will likely ``retreat to their more refined dinner parties, there to cap each other with anecdotes about the awful vulgarities of the british.''
the observer, a liberal weekly, in a profile of the 28-year-old duchess, said: ``something appears to have gone awry with the royal fairy story.''
the newspapers were particularly critical of the duchess' quip, ``i'll see you later,'' to a man who yelled out, ``i love you,'' breaking a fake bottle over her husband's head and what they saw as generally failed attempts at humor
the sunday times, in an article by sketch writer craig brown, criticized british daily newspapers for using headlines such as ``hollywood bows to a touch of british class'' and ``royal one-liners woo u.s. hosts.''
of a black-tie dinner at which the duchess wore a red-and-black gown, brown wrote:
while the stars of hollywood dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows, down the stairs walloped someone who looked as if she'd just won third prize for her carmen miranda impersonation in an end of pier show at some forgotten resort.''
the observer asked, ``has the duchess of york gone too far?'' and added, ``even in this day and age it is easily possible for noblesse to be too obliging.''
a continental airlines airliner that crashed and left 28 people dead waited 24 minutes in a snowstorm between de-icing and takeoff while other aircraft were taking off only 15 minutes after de-icing, officials said today
robert benzon, heading a national transportation safety board investigation team, said possible ice buildup on continental flight 1713 would be among the ``items of interest'' to be considered as four days of hearings into the november crash began
the dc-9, powered by two pratt &amp; whitney jt8d-7 engines, had just lifted off when it rolled over and broke into three pieces as it slid down a snow-covered runway. twenty-eight people were killed and 54 others were injured
other possible crash causes being considered included the inexperience of the pilots and a wingtip vortex from a plane landing on an adjacent runway, benzon said in an opening statement
flight attendant kelly englehart testified today that she had been so worried about the weather and the co-pilot's inexperience that she asked the pilot who would be landing the plane in the snowstorm when the flight returned to denver
it as snowing outside, and the weather was pretty bad. it was the second officer's second trip, and i just wanted to know,'' said englehart, adding that capt. frank zvonek told her he would land the plane
benzon noted that said that zvonek, 43, who had 198 hours on a dc-9 with only the previous 33 hours as captain, and first officver lee bruecher, 26, never had flown together before. both were killed
benzon said the ntsb investigation showed the temperature was 28 degrees fahrenheit and the wind was blowing at 10 knots, gusting to 17 knots, when the plane was being prepared for takeoff
the tower personnel (the control tower) could not see the de-icing pad or the end of the runway because of low visibility,'' he said
he said 24 minutes elapsed between the time the plane was de-iced and the time the plane took off
other aircraft on the ramp during this time frame were spending approximately 15 minutes between de-icing and takeoff,'' he said
the reasons for flight 1713's 24-minute delay and the possible effects of snow or ice buildup on the wings and tail surfaces of the airplane during this delay are items of interest during this hearing,'' benzon said
englehart, the first of 29 scheduled witnesses, then testified that she closed her eyes and prepared to die as the plane slid down a snow-covered runway at denver's airport last nov. 15
she the dc-9 had just lifted off the runway at stapleton international airport when it rocked first to the left and then sharply to the right, finally turning over and coming to a stop
a six-week-old baby in my section started screaming and everybody was so glad to hear that baby cry. they knew the baby was all right,'' she said
about 30 minutes of recorded cockpit conversation showed that the crew used the appropriate checklist before taking off, said benzon
the wreckage also showed the landing gear was down and locked and the flaps were at an appropriate takeoff setting upon impact, he said
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said monday that engine failure will not be discussed because there has been no evidence that the engines failed
the chairman of the board of inquiry is ntsb board member joseph t. nall, assisted by three other ntsb staff members. ``a final report is still many months down the road,'' said lopatkiewicz
the federal aviation administration, meanwhile, announced plans monday for ``white-glove inspections'' of continental airlines, possibly as early as this summer
the continental inspection is part of a continuing effort by the faa to take a regularly scheduled, full-scale look at the operations of big domestic airlines, said faa spokesman fred farrar
the world health organization's chief aids investigator said tuesday that sex experts william masters and virginia johnson were ``irresponsible'' for suggesting aids can be transmitted by casual social contact
dr. jonathan mann, the american director of who's global program on aids, challenged the noted sex researchers to produce scientific evidence or admit they were indulging in ``idle speculation.''
if it's just theorizing, then i think they have done us all a grave disservice,'' mann told reporters at the first international conference on the global impact of aids
about 1,100 specialists from 20 countries attended the start of the three-day meeting at london's barbican center
in a new book, masters and johnson claim u.s. health officials have understated the extent of aids among heterosexuals to avoid public panic. they also say that aids might be transmitted by casual contact such as from a toilet seat or a waiter's bleeding finger
they wrote in their book: ``the aids virus is now running rampant in the heterosexual community.'' when that assertion came under fire at a news conference in new york on monday, masters said, ``i simply believe this.'' johnson, asked the same question, said ``i'm not sure we chose the word `rampant' ourselves.''
mann suggested the authors' assertion that aids might be more prevalent among heterosexuals than health officials believe was a matter for debate and might be useful if it strengthened awareness that the disease can be transmitted both heterosexually and homosexually
but if they're talking about putting their prestige behind the idea that you can catch this from a toilet seat, i think that's irresponsible unless there are data.''
mann said he strongly objected to the authors' implication ``without data, without information, that the virus spreads in other ways than we know it spreads.''
mann and most other experts believe aids spreads mainly by sexual contact, through the sharing of needles and from pregnant mothers to their babies
the who official suggested that masters and johnson were trying to promote their book with headline-grabbing findings, saying ``publicity about this will undoubtedly sell more books.''
he also expressed doubt about the authors' scientific qualifications regarding aids
they know a lot about sex. i don't know how much they know about aids,'' said mann, who added that he had not read the book and was responding to news reports about its content
asked again about the masters and johnson study at a later news conference, mann said: ``it would be very unfortunate if their credibility in sex was used by people to give credence to their theorizing rather than to the facts that have been collected about aids in the last seven years from all over the world
during the aids conference, dr. gary noble, deputy director of the centers for disease control in atlanta and head of the federal agency's aids program, also refuted the masters and johnson study without mentioning it by name
he said separate u.s. studies confirmed that aids is not spread through casual social contact. one study showed that infected people did not pass aids to members of their family except through sexual contact. another study showed that insects cannot transmit the virus
noble said that the incidence of aids among heterosexuals in the united states had increased from 1.1 percent of all cases in 1982 to 2.3 percent in 1986. he said health officials expected that proportion to increase to 4 to 5 percent by 1991
in his conference speech, mann said aids sufferers face the danger of discrimination and proposed an international system for monitoring human rights violations in combating the disease
he did not explain how the system would work but said, ``we need to know when and how discrimination occurs.''
we know that in aids, isolation and exclusion create danger and that inclusion creates safety,'' he said
mann said the world health organization had recorded 81,433 aids cases from a total of 133 countries as of march 1
as of feb. 29, the centers for disease control in atlanta had received reports of 54,723 americans with aids, 30,715 of whom had died
the geneva-based u.n. agency is co-sponsoring the conference with the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine
acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the body's natural immune system, making its victims vulnerable to a variety of infections and cancers. it is invariably fatal and there is no known vaccine or cure
ted turner's cable entertainment network could start oct. 3, now that turner broadcasting system's board approved it
the board monday unanimously approved the proposed turner network television, or tnt, which turner said will compete directly with the three major networks
with tnt, we are offering the cable industry the programming vehicle to drive penetration past the 60 and 70 percent marks,'' turner said in a statement
at present, about half the homes in the country with televisions subscribe to cable television
turner broadcasting is prepared to invest up to $30 million in tnt through the end of 1990. plans call for the network to be offered free to cable operators in 1988, but they will be charged 15 cents per subscriber in 1989, with the fee rising to 20 cents in 1990 and 25 cents in 1991
the new network is envisioned as an alternative to cbs, nbc and abc that will eventually offer first-run programming, major sporting events and awards shows. turner has said the company's contract with the national basketball association could allow a shift of games from superstation tbs to tnt once the latter reaches 30 million homes
we will begin immediately to solicit subscriber commitments, and preliminary indications from cable operators show strong and substantial support,'' turner said
prime cable in atlanta has agreed to become the first cable system to carry tnt, said allan barnes, vice president and general manager of prime cable
tnt will provide us with the kind of breakthrough programming we need to draw new subscribers,'' barnes said
tnt would become turner's fourth cable network, joining cable news network, cnn headline news and superstation tbs
police today found what appears to be the painting by french impressionist claude monet that was stolen from the fisher community center nearly a year ago
we're extremely pleased,'' said rex ryden, head of the fisher foundation. ``obviously, it's going to be something that will be of value as far as the entire art world is concerned.''
lt. darrell templeton said the department recovered the painting in a mail drop box in legrand, about nine miles east of marshalltown
the painting, ``the fishing boats in front of the cliffs at d'etretat,'' is to be examined to see if it is the original. ryden said the painting was rolled up when found and that templeton unrolled it just far enough to determine that it may be the monet
ryden said officials will not bend nor otherwise tamper with the painting for fear that it might be damaged in the process
the painting, valued at up to $300,000, was stolen march 19, 1987. authorities soon after called in the fbi and the international police agency interpol to help locate it
the painting was stolen by a man who rushed into the center at night, carved the 23-by-32 inch canvas from its frame and vanished on foot
ryden said the foundation's insurance carrier paid $175,000 for its loss. ``i'm not sure who owns that painting now, since the insurance company paid us for it,'' he said. pvs, rep. stephen.</note>
the reagan administration said today it intends to keep holding the threat of sanctions over panama's gen. manuel antonio noriega, but said no decisions have been made on possible actions
the threat's still out there. we're still considering it. the situation is changing rapidly and we're still monitoring it. but we don't want to act precipitously,'' white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters
he made the comments to clarify statements he'd made earlier indicating the administration might be withholding a decision on possible economic and trade sanctions
earlier in the day, the house foreign affairs committee voted unanimously to endorse reagan's course of action against the military regime and to urge him to consider further economic sanctions
the administration has called for noriega's removal since he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in florida last month
the sanctions are being considered as a means of bringing pressure against noriega's military regime and to promote a return to civilian rule under president eric arturo delvalle
let me back you away from the inevitability of these kinds of decisions,'' the spokesman had said initially, adding, ``it's been our feeling from the very beginning that change should come from within in panama and we should watch it carefully and if that is the process, that is preferable to our taking actions.''
but fitzwater later returned to the briefing room to say, ``we want to keep the threat of sanctions still out there.''
he said the options were still before the administration, but that no decisions had yet been made. he said such decisions depended upon ``a very complicated set of criteria.''
he cited the impact the sanctions might have on the status of the noriega government, u.s. interests in terms of the canal, the panamanian military and u.s. investment in that country
fitzwater also offered support for statements issued by delvalle and opposition parties that have called for the establishment of a ``government of national reconciliation.''
we welcome those statements,'' the spokesman said. he also issued a statement saying the u.s. government supports the goal of ``restoring democratic government and civilian constitutional order. once this goal has been achieved, we will work cooperatively with the government of panama toward the recovery of panama's financial and economic health.''
the house foreign affairs committee resolution, which will be voted on by the house later this week, also reaffirmed congressional support for the full implementation of the panama canal treaties which require the united states to hand the canal over to panama at the end of the century
rep. stephen j. solarz, d-n.y., noted that panama's military ruler, gen. manuel antonio noriega, has said that the criticism from the united states aimed at his alleged involvement in drug trafficking and other acts of corruption is actually a smoke screen
noriega is contending the real reason is to create the groundwork for an ultimate american decision to renege on the commitment to turn over the panama canal'' in the year 2000, solarz said
this resolution shows that we fully intend to live up to our commitments under the panama canal treaties,'' solarz said
the senate foreign relations committee already has adopted a resolution calling for a total trade embargo against panama, but several members of the house panel said they thought that approach was premature
several members said their resolution is more in tune with reagan administration measured strategy and is essentially an endorsement of a targeted approach designed to put pressure on noriega while not harming the panamanian people as a whole. says</head>
cheating on federal income taxes has declined by as much as 20 percent, mainly because of tax law changes and tougher federal policing, internal revenue service commissioner lawrence b. gibbs said tuesday
gibbs told a house appropriations subcommittee an irs study indicates the much-publicized ``tax gap'' _ the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid _ has dropped to between $80 billion and $90 billion in 1987. the agency's last report on the annual gap estimated it would rise to more than $100 billion in 1987
gibbs attributed the decline to campaigns by congress and the irs to force stricter compliance, through tougher penalties and the computer-matching of tax returns with income reports, and to the numerous changes brought about by the 1986 tax law revision
the commissioner announced also that the irs has temporarily suspended efforts to collect back taxes from students who were paid stipends for teaching or research work at their universities
we've put the word out (to irs offices) to hold up on any'' of the students' cases that are pending until the agency adopts a consistent policy on how such income should be treated, gibbs said
he said cases affecting students who receive stipends developed from a computer matching of employer reports with students' tax returns _ not from any irs initiative to ``go after the graduate students.''
in dispute are stipends paid in 1984, 1985 and 1986. the 1986 tax revision declared all such stipends to be taxable income
irs officials said they had no estimate how many students are involved in the controversy, although the washington post on tuesday quoted unofficial estimates of up to 17,000 cases
apparently there are some inconsistencies in the way the examination of students' returns are being conducted,'' irs spokesman steve pyrek said. there is a wide variety of stipends paid by colleges and universities, he noted, and some irs field offices are following court decisions on the issue while others abide by a 1975 ruling by the agency itself
in looking at the cases, case law is a lot harsher (toward students) than our rules,'' gibbs told the subcommittee
the students' troubles began when their colleges sent the irs copies of w-2 wage statements indicating they were paid taxable wages. when the students filed their tax returns, the computer indicated those wages were not reported as income
gibbs said the irs hopes to announce within a month new guidelines on treatment of such stipends from the three earlier tax years
also within a short time, the commissioner said, he hopes to be able to report on the new estimate of the tax gap. he declined to provide any details of the new findings but told the subcommittee: ``the amount of the tax gap has diminished since the last time we did a study.''
the last irs study of the tax gap was published in 1983 and was based on 1981 information. it estimated that individuals and corporations dodged $81.5 billion in taxes on legal income that year, by understating income and overstating deductions
the agency estimated that another $9 billion in taxes was lost on three types of illegal income: drugs, prostitution and gambling. the new report will not even attempt to estimate the tax loss from illegal income that is never reporte
since the last tax-gap study was published, irs researchers have reported evidence that taxpayers may be cheating less. in may 1986, the agency released a report indicating that a 20-year trend of declining compliance with the tax laws might have been reversed
that study estimated that voluntary compliance rose to 91.8 percent in 1982, from 91.0 percent in 1979. compliance had declined steadily from 94.3 percent in 1965
the vatican newspaper on tuesday criticized attempts by the families and friends of the accused to discredit a 30-year-old woman raped by three men
the woman walking to her car early sunday was beaten and raped repeatedly by three men near the piazza navona in central rome. a police patrol came on the scene of the attack and arrested the men
digging into the private life of the victim, the three `good boys' _ as they were defined by family and friends _ are trying to appear to be the victims, wrapping the only true victim of the incident in a halo of allusions, of accusations that are not even well veiled,'' the vatican newspaper osservatore romano said in an editorial
it criticized the parents of the defendants, saying they expressed ``wonder that a woman should walk around alone at that hour, rather than being upset and expressing pain for the crime committed by their sons.''
even if the assaulted woman was the last of the outcast, if she was addicted to drugs or alcohol _ as some have suggested _ the responsibility of the aggressors not only would not diminish, it would increase.''
the editorial came tuesday as italy celebrated women's day with feminist speeches and calls for stronger measures to combat rape
christian democratic senator rosa russo jervolino, minister for special affairs and the only woman in the cabinet, also criticized the defendants and their families
the behavior (of the three men and their families) shows a distorted mentality which has completely lost sight of the value of personal freedom,'' she said, ``we have a great job to do of cultural restructuring.'' chairman</head>
the comptroller of the currency has dismissed proposed civil penalties against a former michigan bank chairman accused of misusing bank funds
the ruling monday by comptroller robert l. clarke overturned an administrative law judge's recommendation that stanford stoddard, former chairman of michigan national corp., be fined $146,000 for allegedly misusing $167,385 in bank resources for private purposes, including wedding receptions, maintenance of home and vacation properties and renovation of mormon churches
although mr. stoddard flagrantly misused bank funds, the bank's expenditures ... do not constitute extensions of credit,'' clarke said in his ruling. ``accordingly, the civil money penalty shall not be assessed.''
stoddard, 57, was removed as chairman of the bank holding company in 1984 after the comptroller began investigating his activities
the son of the bank's founder, stoddard had run the company since 1972
stoddard's attorney, richard roberts, said, ``our position ... has always been that he did not (misuse funds), that the funds were expended properly for him, either as ... charitable contributions in the instance of the church properties, reimbursement or proper expenditure on his behalf for entertainment, and other permissible expenditures by a corporation on behalf of its chief executive officer.''
the comptroller's ruling said stoddard used bank funds for four purposes: renovation of buildings that were or were to become mormon churches; improvements to his residence, vacation home and florida condominium; payment of bills for a wedding reception for his children and friends; and extensive personal secretarial and errand services
the money was spent on salaries for bank employees assigned to work on the projects, payment of bills for supplies, use of bank supplies, and direct payments to contractors, the comptroller's ruling said
roberts said stoddard had paid the bank about $280,000 as reimbursement
in a separate statement, clarke said his decision was not intended to condone ``mr. stoddard's blatant misapplication of bank funds.''
congress may wish to consider amending the appropriate statutes to make it possible to asssess civil money penalties in similar circumstances in the future,'' clarke said
higher stamp prices won't take effect until next month, postal officials said tuesday after postponing a final decision on the effective date of the new rates
the board of governors of the u.s. postal service will hold a special meeting march 22 to discuss putting the new rates into effect
although no definite decision on an effective date for rates has been scheduled, the board has set april 3 as the target date to give mailers advance notice to plan for the new rates,'' the agency said in a statement issued following its meeting tuesday
under the law, the agency has to give 10 days notice once it votes to impose new rates, so a vote on march 22 could get the new prices in force by april 3, which is also easter this year
the new prices, recommended by the independent postal rate commission last friday following 10 months of deliberation, call for a sweeping series of increases averaging more than 17 percent. included would be a 25-cent first-class rate
at tuesday's meeting, new postmaster general anthony frank said he would like to restore some of the recently cut postal services when higher stamp prices take effect, but he was concerned about the costs involved
post office window openings and sorting hours were cut in january in an effort to comply with congressional spending limits
the higher postage rates are not connected to those cuts, having been proposed nearly a year ago to help compensate for the agency's overall budgetary problems
but, frank admitted, explaining to the public the reasons for reduced services at the same time rates are rising ``is a very difficult message to get out.''
frank said expanded window hours at some offices are being considered, at least to help out during the changeover from one set of rates to another
in addition, he said many offices will stay open until midnight april 15 to accept last-minute tax forms
the postal service, meanwhile, announced that it is offering telephone sales of stamps nationwide during the transition to the new rates
callers will be able to use visa and mastercard credit cards to order the new undenominated ``e'' stamps, with the stamps to be mailed out once the final decision is made on the new rate
customers who want to order the non-denominated stamps can do so, 24 hours a day, by calling 1-800-stamp24. the minimum order will be $12.50 plus a $2 service charge
sales of stamps by telephone have been tested in eight cities since last fall, with total sales now of more than $2 million
in addition to the new ``e'' stamps, which can be used only for letters within the united states, some post offices still have supplies of 25-cent stamps featuring a portrait of writer jack london
in addition, consumers with supplies of 22-cent stamps will be able to purchase stamps to make up the difference between those and the new rates
a new 3-cent stamp showing a conestoga wagon was released feb. 29, and some supplies of the 3-cent stamp showing dr. paul dudley white may also be available. post offices also should have 2-cent stamps featuring mary lyon and 1-cent stamps with the likeness of margaret mitchell
speed-the-plow,'' the new david mamet play starring madonna and produced by the lincoln center theater, will bypass that cultural complex altogether and open directly on broadway, a spokesman said tuesday
the play was to have been performed at the small, 299-seat mitzi newhouse theater in lincoln center before moving to broadway's royale theater in late april, said merle debuskey
now it will begin preview performances april 9 at the royale for a may opening, possibly may 3, debuskey said. he said ``boys' life,'' the current tenant at the newhouse, will extend its run there until june 5. the play, written by howard korder, was to have closed march 13
the lincoln center theater, run by gregory mosher and bernard gersten, has has experienced a booking jam at its two theaters. ``anything goes'' has been a solid hit at the larger vivian beaumont theater where it opened in october. debuskey said the vintage cole porter musical would remain until july 31 and then transfer to broadway
the lincoln center theater opened its fall season at the mitzi newhouse with ``sarafina!'', a south african musical which has moved to broadway. following ``boys' life'' at the newhouse will be ``road,'' by english playwright jim cartwright. it will open june 29
debuskey also confirmed that ``waiting for godot,'' starring steve martin, robin williams, f. murray abraham and bill irwin, would be on the company's fall schedule. it will begin performances oct. 25 at the newhouse, he said
the soviet union, accused of foot-dragging by reagan administration officials, has presented drafts of two key provisions of a treaty to sharply reduce u.s. and soviet strategic nuclear weapons
one of the documents submitted to american negotiators in geneva deals with ways to guard against cheating and the other with procedures for eliminating the weapons
a u.s. official, speaking tuesday only on condition of anonymity, said there were ``big areas of disagreement'' with the american positions in some respects and accord in others
he said the soviet drafts, which were submitted monday, were being translated from russian, and a full appraisal by the u.s. side was not complete
the aim is to have the treaty ready for president reagan and soviet general secretary mikhail s. gorbachev to sign at their next superpower summit meeting. it will be held in moscow in late may or early june
the treaty would reduce the total arsenals of u.s. and soviet long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent
charles e. redman, the state department spokesman, said ``it's encouraging we have the drafts on the table.'' but, redman said, the ``real proof of the pudding'' will be whether the soviet proposals can be meshed with u.s. drafts
still to come from moscow is a memorandum of understanding outlining the numbers and locations of soviet strategic weapons. the u.s. memorandum was offered last week
secretary of state george p. shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard a. shevardnadze decided feb. 22 in moscow to give the negotiators a month to agree on the three treaty protocols. the idea is to have them ready for review by shultz and shevardnadze when they meet in washington on march 22-24
last friday, a u.s. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said american negotiator s. read hanmer had complained ``very forcefully'' that moscow had failed to submit its verification and other proposals
at the same time, phyllis oakley, the state department's deputy spokeswoman, publicly criticized the soviets for not presenting their drafts. she said the complex issues required time for thorough study
the negotiators face a number of obstacles in trying to get the treaty ready. ways to verify compliance with a cutback agreement is only one problem
another is the u.s. strategic defense initiative, which the soviets want to restrict. president reagan has vowed not to give ground, however, in the u.s. search for a space-based shield against soviet ballistic missiles
another roadblock is the extreme difficulty in monitoring mobile missiles and some of the other weapons that may be covered by the treaty
five italian sisters showed their latest furry creations at fall-winter shows tuesday alongside the real skins, and they dared the audience to guess which was which
women who still yearn to wear the big cats can now choose the fendi sisters' version consisting of ocelot markings printed on synthetic fur fabric coats with the added bonus of cuffs in real sable
karl lagerfeld, who designs the fendi collection, is never short on witty ideas and when he wasn't making fabric look like fur, he was reversing the process to make furs imitate fabrics. his long winter coats in shaved weasel worked to look like corduroy velvet were a case in point
there were plenty of other surprises, such as the big muffs in chinchilla or sable which, at a flick of the models' wrists, became complete fur coats
but although lagerfeld had his fun with the fakes, he also indulged in the real thing, showing styles in sumptuous mink, sable, ermine and mongolian lamb so lavish that that they could retail for as much as $100,000
favored shapes included high-waisted, oval-skirted coats that harked back to the fashions in vogue in the early 1920s. shoulders were soft and natural with padding sent into retirement
there were spectacular capes such as the circular version in black-dyed mole threaded intricately into lace, and shapely coats in black ermine worked to look like shiny and matte-striped silk velvet
a princess-line coat, fitted and flared, came in woven gray wool and had an extra layer of warmth in its luxury lining of sumptuous chinchilla. monuments</head>
a house subcommittee tuesday approved prime national park sites in washington for two new monuments honoring korean war veterans and the 5,000 black patriots who supported the american revolution
interior secretary donald hodel's designation of both proposed monuments as being of ``pre-eminent historical and lasting significance to the nation'' was endorsed by the house interior subcommittee on national parks and public lands by voice vote
under a 1986 law, congressional approval of such a designation authorizes construction of new monuments on choice parkland in washington that includes the capitol grounds, the mall, the ellipse, west potomac park and constitution gardens
the exact sites for the korean war veterans memorial and the black revolutionary war patriots memorial will be determined later. congress already had authorized construction of the two monuments, and the senate recently approved building both on preferred land
rep. nancy l. johnson, r-conn., said at a subcommittee hearing tuesday that there is only one monument in the capital that honors a black american, a memorial to mary mcleod bethune in a remote city park
both monuments will be built with private funds and maintained by the national park service
a haitian sailing vessel with 60 people aboard was intercepted monday about 300 miles southeast of miami, a u.s. coast guard spokesman said
a ship holding 190 haitians without legal entry papers was found saturday by the coast guard, and passengers were being sent back to port-au-prince
monday's interception was made by the cutter vigorous near crooked island in the bahamas chain, said coast guard spokesman luis diaz
the 45 men, 12 women and three children will be taken back to haiti by the vigorous, he said
coast guard vessels were also searching monday for another ship reportedly in the area, said diaz
diaz said there had been a lull in haitian interceptions in recent months, and that the two seizures could signal renewed efforts to enter the country illegally
a judge has denied a motion to reconsider his reduction of a $10.5 million jury award to an 83-year-old woman who was struck in the eye by a 7-up bottle cap
third district court judge kenneth rigtrup on monday let stand his feb. 17 reduction to $375,000 the damages due mae roberts of holladay
rigtrup said the jurors were ``inflamed with passion'' and had awarded damages that were ``disproportionate and unreasonable.''
rigtrup awarded $75,000 in compensatory and $300,000 in punitive damages. the jury had awarded $500,000 in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages
colin king, the plaintiff's attorney, has said the judge's action would nullify the jury's attempt to punish 7-up and to send a message to bottlers that negligence would not be tolerated
roberts was struck in the eye when an aluminum twist-off cap blew off a soda bottle she was opening with a pair of pliers. as a result, the sight in her left eye was impaired
king said roberts is unlikely to seek another trial because of her age
a justice department official said tuesday he favors raising congressional pay to as much as $175,000 in exchange for ending a ``double standard'' exempting senators and representatives from federal ethics laws
assistant attorney general william weld said it is ``neither logical nor ... consonant with the notion of fair play'' to make it a crime for executive branch officials to accept fees or honoraria for job-related activities, while allowing members of congress to do so
in a national press club speech attacking public corruption, weld said he favors ``raising the salary of all members of congress to a level around somewhere between $150,000 and $175,000 a year. this would enable you to do some other things like prohibit honoraria.''
it would very, very expensive, and ... worth every penny,'' said weld, head of the department's criminal division
currently, congressional salaries are $89,500 a year, which senators may supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed 40 percent of their salaries. the percentage for house members is 30 percent
at worst'' the payment and acceptance of fees and honoraria ``can degenerate into a case of veiled extortion or a case of veiled gratuity,'' weld said
weld also said congress should apply to itself the federal conflict-of-interest laws under which former white house political director lyn nofziger was convicted of illegal lobbying. congress has exempted itself from those laws
weld noted that while a member of congress is free to lobby his former colleagues the day after he leaves office, ``as recent events have made abundantly clear, such behavior by a former member of the executive branch would land one in jail.''
nofziger was found guilty of lobbying former white house associates within one year after he left the government on matters in which the agency had been substantially involved: a federal contract for wedtech corp.; the continued production of a10 anti-tank aircraft; and civilian manning of navy ships. nofziger faces sentencing later this month
weld rejected the suggestion that he was raising the congressional ethics issue in an election year to overshadow the fact that a number of reagan administration officials are under criminal investigation or have been convicted of crimes
weld's boss, attorney general edwin meese iii, is under criminal investigation by an independent counsel
my remarks today are the same as remarks i've been giving since ... 1978 ... so it's no recently cooked-up farrago,'' weld said. ``i'm speaking about legislation when i talk about double standard, not anybody's performance. i'm not saying one branch has a monopoly on sleaze.''
weld also expressed support for the 1978 ethics in government act under which independent counsels and the office of government ethics police federal ethics laws in the executive branch. the investigation of meese was launched last may 11 under that law
i like the ethics in government act. i think it's a good statute'' and ``i think it deserves to be enforced,'' weld said
a former u.s. attorney in boston, weld said that when he came to washington in 1986, he mistakenly thought a dozen congressmen might have broken the law when they accepted $2,000 fees in a visit to a commercial enterprise over which their committee had jurisdiction
a deputy informed him ``that only members of the wicked and nefarious executive branch and independent agencies are prohibited from supplementing their salaries,'' he recalled. ``that very same action ... would be a lay down criminal case if performed by somebody in the executive branch.''
the congressmen justified taking the fees by saying they expected to be compensated for their time
compensation is the word used in the criminal statute, which ``shows you how deep that double standard runs,'' said weld
rep. barney frank, d-mass., agreed with weld's suggestions, saying his house subcommittee will address the congressional exemptions with proposed legislation
frank is chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations
honoraria and fees ``give both the appearance and in some cases the reality of improper influence,'' frank said. regarding conflicts of interest, frank said that when ``a one-time colleague'' leaves congress and ``next month is asking for a favor, personal feeling gets into it that's not legitimate.''
about 4,000 supporters of president joaquin balaguer marched through the capital tuesday on the eve of a 48-hour general strike called by the opposition
to the conspirators, we're going to give hell,'' shouted the balaguer supporters, who ended their afternoon rally at the national palace
a tense calm prevailed in the rest of the city of 1.5 million. police and soldiers were out in force, but the barricades, burning tires and stone-throwing mobs of last week were absent
wednesday's strike was called by the national conference of popular organizations, which claims to represent about 200 groups. the issue is the soaring cost of living in this caribbean nation of 6 million
inflation last year rose 30 percent, according to private economists, who predict that this year it will top 50 percent. the central bank estimates inflation hit 16 percent in 1987
coalition spokesman fabio ruiz said balaguer's pledge to implement price controls on bananas, onions, potatoes, rice and beans, ``don't satisfy our demands.''
the coalition also rejected balaguer's pledge, made last month, to increase the minimum wage by 33 percent to about $75 a month
rising prices for gasoline, meat and other basic commodities have touched off protests in several of the dominican republic's 26 provinces. in the past two weeks, six people have been killed and about 20 injured by gunshots, tear gas or stones. several hundred people have been detained
leftist groups and unions claimed tuesday that police arrested some of their leaders _ including diaz jaquez of the dominican workers party and rafael abreu of the general workers central _ without warrant, and interrogated others
armed forces minister lt. gen. antonio imbert barrera said soldiers will patrol city streets and give ``full support'' to the national police
the strike wednesday is opposed by the main labor unions, the dominican revolutionary party, which is the main opposition party, and the influential roman catholic church. those groups and others have urged that compromises be negotiated to resolve the economic problems
a u.s. official said tuesday he would view as ``unfriendly'' any votes against a proposed united nations inquiry into alleged human rights violations in cuba
vernon walters, the top u.s. representative to the united nations, made the statement at a luncheon for international officials and business leaders as he stepped up pressure on allies to back the u.s.-sponsored proposal
walters also told the 43-member u.n. human rights commission on tuesday that it should examine the alleged human rights violations in cuba or risk becoming ``accomplices of oppression.''
he said a more harshly worded version of the proposal failed to pass last year by one vote for political reasons. the united states has complained of political bias at the commission, which often has condemned human rights violations in israeli-occupied territories, south africa and chile
walters said torture and secret executions continue in cuba and that ``freedom exists only to the extent that (cuban leader) fidel castro decides it can.''
the resolution, which will come before the commission this week, urges the cuban government to permit the international red cross to investigate prison conditions. it also asks the u.n. secretary-general to investigate alleged human rights violations
prime minister margaret thatcher said tuesday that britain's current military exercise to reinforce the falkland islands against possible attack by argentina was ``no one else's business.''
flatly rejecting protests by argentina and other latin american countries, mrs. thatcher told the house of commons that britain had a right and also ``a duty to see that reinforcement proposals could in fact be carried out.''
it is no one else's business except the defense of people's rights in the falkland islands,'' said mrs. thatcher
about 900 troops will travel 8,000 miles next week to the falkland islands from brize norton air base, north of london, as part of the exercise, called fire focus
the exercise began this week with mythical ``intelligence reports'' warning that argentina was preparing again to invade the south atlantic archipelago which it has long claimed. the 1,800 british-descended islanders fiercely reject argentine rule
fire focus is the first major maneuver announced by britain since it recaptured the islands from invading argentine troops in a 74-day war in 1982
britain has said it gave notice last month to argentina of the intended exercise and has since announced that fire focus will involve fewer than 1,000 men
britain maintains a garrison, reportedly of about 2,000 men, on the islands and says it must practice sending in reinforcements in order to avoid keeping more troops there permanently
briefing reporters at brize norton on tuesday, foreign office assistant under secretary robin fearn said fire focus ``threatens no one. it is entirely defensive.''
far from being a cause for concern, it is an integral part of our policy of reducing tension,'' he added
he said the initial post-war garrison had been halved in recent years after the completion of a new runway at the falklands capital, port stanley, which can take wide-bodied jets. cash problem</head>
a $350,000 shortfall is casting a shadow on the largest-ever soviet-u.s. cultural exchange, a three-week festival viewed by the state department as an important symbol of improved relations with moscow, fund-raisers said tuesday
with three days to go before its scheduled opening, ``making music together'' is heavily in the red because of unexpected costs, said harold hestes, president of the greater boston chamber of commerce
hestes declined to detail what drove costs above the estimated budget of $2.4 million, but said revised figures put the price tag for the 80-event festival at about $3.3 million
festival operating co. which is managing the american part of the exchange, last month seriously considered the idea of declaring bankruptcy and canceling the event, said lawyer gabor garai
instead, company directors agreed to try and raise additional funds ``in light of the national and international importance of the event,'' said garai, whose firm, hale and dorr, is providing free legal counsel to organizers
billed by u.s. organizers as the largest cultural exchange ever with the soviet union, the festival, which runs though april 2, will feature 285 soviet musicians, dancers, composers and other artists performing in the boston area
it will continue in moscow in the fall of 1989, where the festival will concentrate on contemporary american music
organizers originally had hoped to cover most costs through ticket sales, a state contribution of $450,000 and private sector pledges of $350,000
the state has promised to provide more grants and loans amounting to $400,000, and businessess and charitable organizations have pledged an additional $150,000, hestes said
of the outstanding $350,000, hestes said, ``we're doing our best to raise it (but) the cash flow situation is extremely tight.''
it would be my hope that that the festival goes on no matter what, as it would be tragedy for the state and the nations if it would fail,'' he said
hestes said he contacted the state department about possible cancellation recently, and ``the clear inference ... (was) that it would be bad for our relations with the soviet union.''
secretary of state george p. shultz expressed his personal support and that of president ronald reagan last year, in a letter to sarah caldwell, a key organizer of the exchange and artistic director of the opera company of boston
i want you to know that both the president and i personally support these exchanges ....,'' he wrote to ms. caldwell. ``these exchanges will continue to be an important element in the u.s.-soviet relationship.''
ms. caldwell provided a copy of the sept. 8 letter to the associated press
in washington, greg guroff, of the government-run u.s. information agency, said he believes the soviet union ``has made a tremendous commitment to this festival.''
guroff, head of the agency's office of u.s.-soviet exchanges and a former cultural attache to the u.s. embassy in moscow, said the soviets would interpret cancellation as a rebuff
because of guaranteed state funding of such events in the soviet union, ``the american concept of fund-raising for most soviets ...(is) not only incomprehensible, but it's not their problem,'' said guroff. ``we have had two or three performing arts exchanges that have fallen through from lack of funding: the fallout was quite considerable in the soviets' minds.''
supreme court justice sandra day o'connor was reported ``in good spirits'' and feeling well tuesday after having her appendix removed
o'connor, 57, underwent the surgery monday night at bethesda naval hospital
court spokeswoman toni house said o'connor was feeling ``exceedingly well'' but gave few other details
justice antonin scalia, asked about o'connor after he testified before a house subcommittee on the supreme court's budget request for next fiscal year, said he had spoken to her by telephone tuesday morning
she sounded in good spirits,'' he said. ``i think she'll be back to work shortly.''
o'connor had been scheduled to testify with scalia but she was taken to the hospital in midafternoon monday, and was operated on about 8 p.m
scalia explained o'connor's absence to the subcommittee members by saying, ``she had a supervening appointment with an appendectomy.''
jed christensen, director of the office of surface mining for the past three years, is leaving his job march 20, the interior department announced tuesday
christensen, who served as the government's chief regulator of strip mining longer than anyone else, will become assistant chief administrative officer of fresno county, calif
his boss will be dan fitzpatrick, with whom he worked previously when chistensen was a budget officer for clark county, nev. ``he called me (just after taking office) and asked if i would be interested ... i will be getting back to my roots.''
he said he was ``not in the least'' pushed out
christensen also has worked in local government in provo, utah; phoenix, ariz and santa anna, calif
he came to the interior department in 1981 and was appointed acting director of the office of surface mining in april 1985, winning nomination as director in december 1985 and confirmation in may 1986
robert h. gentile, an aide to steven griles, assistant secretary for land and minerals management, has been appointed deputy to chistensen for operations, the department said
christensen said it was ``up to the secretary'' to decide on a successor, but other officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, said they expected gentile to be named acting director, perhaps for the remainder of the reagan administration
the office, formed by congress in 1977 after a decade of bitter debate, was subjected to a wrenching reorganization by then-secretary james watt in 1981. when christensen took over, some violation records were still stored in shoeboxes
christensen said most of the $150 million in penalties represented by those boxes would be written off by the end of this fiscal year, with about 15 percent of the amount finally collected, and the records now kept on a computer
his tenure also has seen installation of another computer system to match applicants for mining permits in the states against the list of outstanding violations, and the abolition by congress of the exemption from most regulation for mines under two acres. that exemption had enabled some big companies in virginia and kentucky to break their operations into a ``string of pearls'' _ mines of less than two acres operated by subcontractors
i'm amazed at the things we've accomplished,'' he said, listing among other things better relations with the states and forthcoming proposals for criminal penalties for mining without a permit and for incentives for miners to take coal from and reclaim abandoned mines
thomas galloway, a washington lawyer who has represented environmental groups in several lawsuits against the agency, said christensen's departure was ``not a major move,'' since ``he was not involved in major issues over the past year ... we have been dealing with the assistant secretary's office.''
galloway said he believed the office was ``probably in the worst shape it's been since 1977'' in terms of competence and effectiveness, which he said was ``not entirely the reagan administration's fault.''
i believe abuse is continuing unchecked'' in parts of kentucky, west virginia, virginia and tennessee, largely at the hands of miners operating on a shoestring, galloway said
rep. mike synar, d-okla., who as chairman of the environment subcommittee of the house government operations committee has produced several reports critical of the office, said a change in directors ``will be meaningless, just like all the others have been.'' opponent</head>
off-duty police gathered signatures at polling places tuesday in a drive to abolish a citizens review board, but said they abandoned their efforts at one site after being confronted by a city council member
in at least one of the polling places, we had to leave because (mayor pro tem) diane ragsdale and some of her cohorts started to create problems, so we just decided to leave because it was not worth it,'' said dallas police association president monica smith
ms. ragsdale started an argument, trying to convince people not to sign the petitions, and rather than getting it to escalate, we pulled out,'' said ms. smith
ms. ragsdale, a vocal critic of the police, said there was no confrontation
this gentleman wanted to know from me what to do. he wanted to know about the issue because, you know, many of them _ actually, some of our citizens, seniors _ really don't know,'' she said
they do not realize what they are doing,'' she said. ``they attempted to circumvent their policy makers.''
but one dpa spokesman, larry mcgowan, said ms. ragsdale grabbed one man trying to sign a petition
ms. smith said signatures were being collected citywide by about 1,400 off-duty officers, 200 to 300 firefighters and their families. the campaign to abolish the dallas citizens police review board has drawn opposition from a coalition of black business, community, church and elected leaders
the dpa wants the city to hire more officers and abolish the board, which hears complaints against police. the board was formed in january and has met twice
twenty thousand signatures are needed to force a city charter amendment election
the texas secretary of state had poll monitors at voting places, also observing the police effort
three dallas officers have been shot and killed this year, including john chase, who was shot by a deranged transient as a bus-stop crowd watched the homeless man ignore the officer's pleas to spare his life
four men have also been killed by officers this year, including the transient who killed chase
opponents of the citizens review board, which has limited subpoena powers, say it duplicates existing panels or agencies, including the police internal affairs department and the dallas county grand jury, and calls into question the department's ability to police itself
northwest lawmakers and representatives of the timber industry said tuesday the new u.s.-canada free trade treaty will do little to open canadian markets to american-manufactured plywood, but reagan administration officials said it was a step in the right direction
it's one-way free trade,'' rep. peter defazio, d-ore., said during a house subcommittee hearing. ``the u.s. is being snookered again.''
both defazio and rep. ron wyden, d-ore., said the treaty will allow canadian plywood manufacturers unrestricted access to american markets but only 10 percent of the canadian market, at best, will be opened to u.s. producers
i think a provision like this provides red meat to the protectionists,'' said wyden, adding that congress should draft strong language covering plywood trade when it consider implementing language for the treaty later this year
oregon is the top plywood producing state in the nation and washington state ranks no. 4. other states in the top five include louisiana, texas and arkansas
an arms dealer charged with plotting to sell weapons to argentina, iraq, poland and the soviet union was asked by u.s. intelligence officials to use his contacts in poland to arrange the purchase of two soviet ``super tanks,'' his attorney said tuesday
solomon schwartz, 52, of monsey, was sought out by the cia in 1982 and later had contact with the defense intelligence agency concerning the possible purchase of the soviet t-72 tanks, which the u.s. government wanted to study for intelligence purposes, said attorney lawrence dubin
schwartz negotiated with three polish generals for the tanks but the sale never materialized, dubin said in his opening statement at the trial of schwartz and three co-defendants, who are also arms dealers
the defendants are accused of plotting four illegal weapons deals, including smuggling military equipment to the argentinian government during the falkland islands war and an unsuccessful attempt to ship guns to iraq
they were willing to sell to anyone, no matter whose hands the weapons fell into, if the price was right,'' said assistant u.s. attorney larry krantz
the argentinian deal, the only one that went through, included the shipment of 1,300 night vision goggles and resulted in a profit of $1 million for the defendants, krantz said
the prosecutor charged that schwartz would use the soviet tank deal to ``cover up'' one of the illegal arms deals, a shipment of 500 automatic rifles and ammunition destined for poland but seized by u.s. customs agents at john f. kennedy airport in february 1984
dubin said the weapons were to be shipped to poland but then would be immediately re-shipped to mexico, using a legal export license, by an independent trading company
he said the arms shipment to poland was needed to establish ``a course of routine business'' in poland to facilitate any possible future dealings involving the soviet tanks
schwartz, the owner of texas armament advisors inc., will testify during the trial about the tank deal, dubin said
the other illegal arms shipments alleged in the indictment involved 110 boxes of handguns, shotguns and ammunition destined for iraq but seized by belgian authorities; and 400 night vision devices to the soviet union in a sting operation orchestrated by u.s. customs. all took place between 1982 and 1984
although these weapons are routinely bought and sold in the u.s., the export of these weapons are highly regulated by the government,'' krantz said. ``the defendants were caught red-handed participating in a series of illegal arms transactions.''
the other defendants are h. leonard berg, 52, of the bronx, owner of hlb security electronics ltd. of manhattan; grim depanicis, 44, of mount dora, fla., a vice president of hlb; leon lisbona, 63, of queens, an hlb employee
berg, lisbona and schwartz are charged with racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud and violating arms export laws and are accused of participating in all four illegal deals
depanicis is not charged with any of the racketeering counts and is named only in the argentinian and soviet union deals
krantz said the trial was expected to last several weeks and would include secretly recorded conversations
thousands of japanese-americans detained in prison camps during world war ii suffered a ``catastrophic deprivation of civil rights,'' an attorney told a federal appeals court tuesday
but the arguments by the attorney representing 120,000 japanese-americans in a $24 billion class-action suit and by the justice department lawyer fighting the suit were far removed from the gruesome details of what appeals court judge helen nies described as ``a disgrace we all know and lived through.''
instead, the hearing before the u.s. circuit court of appeals for the federal circuit focused mainly on whether the statute of limitations had expired in the case
this is the second time a federal appeals court has heard the case. in 1986, the u.s. circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that the government must defend itself at trial against the suit, which seeks compensation for property losses suffered by those interned
in doing so, it overturned a 1984 decision by district court judge louis oberdorfer, who had ruled that a six-year statute of limitations on suits against the government had expired
but the supreme court ruled last june that the issue of whether the lawsuit was filed within the legal deadline should have been decided by a different court _ the u.s. circuit court of appeals for the federal circuit
the only time the supreme court has ruled on the internment itself _ authorized by president franklin d. roosevelt in the wake of the 1941 japanese attack on pearl harbor _ was in 1944, when it found it was a constitutionally acceptable military necessity. government documents discovered later indicate no such military necessity existed
this case involves the catastrophic deprivation of civil rights,'' said benjamin zelenko, attorney for william hohri of chicago, the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit
hohri, a san francisco native who lived in southern california when the war began, said tuesday he was interned at manzanar camp east of the sierra nevada shortly after his 15th birthday. he left for the midwest 2{ years later and never returned to california
zelenko argued that the statute of limitations did not come into play until the early 1980s because of ``deliberate concealment and misrepresentation by the government of critical information regarding its claim of `military necessity.'''
the concealment didn't end until the 1980s, zelenko said, when a congressionally appointed commission found that there was no military necessity for the internment. the policy was ``driven by race prejudice, war hysteria and lack of political leadership,'' he told the three-judge panel of giles rich, phillip baldwin and nies
jay bybee, representing the government, told the court, ``there is no dispute that there were great wrongs done to japanese-americans.... but even when mistakes are made, people must file timely claims for redress...
the plaintiffs have known the basis of their claims since the 1940s,'' said bybee, who contended that they didn't file their suit at that time because they believed the government would have been successful in claiming military necessity for its actions. warmth</head> procter, sted proctor. inserts 1 graf after 13th, `both public...' to add information about his contact with his children.</note>
the death of bill britt, whose body was found in his woods shelter alone and partially devoured by animals, symbolized the fate of society's homeless and eccentric people, a housing court official said tuesday
autopsy results tuesday showed that britt, 52, died of hypothermia and was dead two weeks before he was discovered monday by two of his three children in his makeshift wigwam in brookline, according to the suffolk county medical examiner's report
homeless people, people like britt who say they want to be alone, should be protected in this weather,'' said stanton kessler, a senior pathologist in the medical examiner's office. ``he had no food in him. he had no sleeping bag. this type of thing should be prevented.''
kessler said britt was clothed and wrapped in blankets when he died. identification was ``presumptive,'' he said, because rodents had eaten most of his face, hands and fingers. his feet were intact because they had been dug into the ground and covered with dirt, for warmth, kessler said
britt died in the woods near the chestnut hill reservoir, near the affluent community of the same name where he was born and grew up. he had lived in the woods since 1969 and did not attract much attention until 1985, when officials began trying to move him into public or subsidized housing
britt's continual resistance to being moved brought him national attention and his nickname, ``the hermit of chestnut hill.'' at one point, actor mickey rooney planned to buy the rights to his story. last may he appeared on ``late night with david letterman.''
chief housing court justice e. george daher tried to arrange housing and medical aid for britt despite his repeated lack of cooperation
he represents in a microcosm what happens to the homeless, the unfortunates, the eccentrics in this cold society,'' daher said tuesday. ``no one seemed to care about him. he should have been monitored. someone should have checked in on him, rather than have him die a lonely tragic death like this.''
there are more than 3,400 homeless people in the boston area, according to the city emergency shelter commission director, anne maguire. she said about 150 of them are outside much of the time
but britt was unique, she said, adding, ``most people want shelter.''
others also agreed britt did not fit the typical definition of the homeless or mentally ill
a one-time insurance agent who also worked in procter &amp; gamble's marketing division in new york city 30 years ago, britt had been married with a family. many speculated that a reportedly messy divorce in 1969 fueled his change in lifestyle
both public officials and friends said he was a paradox; a loner who loved to chat with boston college students who went to class just yards from his shelter, an eccentric who said he wanted to be left alone but who regularly pitched stories about himself to the media
the britt children recently were in fairly regular contact with him. ingrid boughner, 28, his daughter, who learned last year that her father was the well-known hermit, said she visited him several times over the last few weeks, leaving him sandwiches and notes that were never touched. britt's body was found dead by her and her brother, britton boughner
mary callahan, 27, met britt as a reporter on a local weekly newspaper. she was one of the first to write about him
it seems so sad to me,'' said callahan, now on the editorial staff of boston college's in-house newspaper. ``he was a singular person, a very interesting man. he looked very old but he was so articulate. he talked about writing poetry, about writing books. it's strange that he decided to live there.''
bill blacker, a box clerk at the chestnut hill post office, said britt came in almost daily to check the mail box he paid $11 for every six months
he talked like such an educated man,'' said blacker. ``i sure wouldn't have wanted to live that way but at least he did what he chose to do. i just think something drastic must have happened to him to make him want to live like that.''
sales of u.s. savings bonds increased for the sixth consecutive month in february, rising 2 percent to $658 million, the government reported tuesday
the treasury department said that february sales were $13 million higher than january and were 2 percent above the level of a year ago, when sales were $646 million
with the inclusion of interest earnings, the value of outstanding bonds rose by $1 billion to total $103.24 billion, 10 percent higher than a year ago
since november 1982, savings bonds held five years or longer have earned market-based interest rates. the current rate, in effect until may 1, is 7.17 percent
former interior secretary william clark was hospitalized after erratic winds flipped his plane as it took off from his private airstrip, his wife said tuesday
he had a little mishap with his small plane,'' said joan clark. ``it isn't serious. he will be out in a day or so.''
clark was taken to twin cities hospital in san luis obispo for observation after monday's accident. the hospital referred all calls to the family business, the clark company, which is involved in real estate and other ventures
clark, 56, was alone at the controls of his super cub aircraft when winds jarred the plane at the family ranch, 160 miles northwest of los angeles, mrs. clark said
the plane overturned and didn't get airborne, she said
clark, who said his job as interior secretary was the most satisfying in decades of public service, resigned jan. 1, 1985, and returned to his california ranch, about 50 miles north of reagan's spread in santa barbara
the internal revenue service on tuesday reminded americans of the newest tax they face: a levy on vaccines that protect against childhood diseases
under a law that congress passed and president reagan signed last december, a tax of up to $4.56 was imposed on shots. the tax must be paid to the government by the manufacturer, producer or importer but nothing in the law prohibits it from being passed on to the patient
the irs issued a routine announcement noting that the tax applies to vaccines sold after dec. 31. the money will be used to compensate people who are injured or who die from receiving commonly prescribed vaccines after sept. 30, 1988
the amount paid in claims, which must be filed in u.s. district court, will be limited by the size of the vaccine fund
the tax is $4.56 for a dose of dpt (diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus) vaccine; 6 cents for diphtheria and tetanus; $4.44 for measles, mumps and rubella, and 29 cents for polio
supreme court justice antonin scalia told a house subcommittee tuesday that trimming the high court's $16.4 budget request could ``cut not fat, not muscle but bone.''
scalia, submitting a budget request for the fiscal year that begins next october, warned that the court cannot withstand an appropriations reduction similar to one imposed for its current budget
we come close to becoming the proverbial turnip'' from which no more blood can be squeezed, scalia said
the court last year requested $16 million for its current, fiscal year 1988 budget but only $15.2 million was appropriated
this has put a very serious strain on the operations of the court during the current fiscal year,'' scalia said
the fiscal year 1989 request includes:
_$100,000 for increased library shelving capacity
_$40,000 to upgrade into legal research databases the word processors the justices and their law clerks use
_$50,000 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the federal law that created the federal court system
the supreme court's budget is handled separately from the billion-dollar budget of the federal court system but most of the subcommittee's questions, focused on problems facing the federal judiciary generally
rep. joseph d. early, d-mass., asked several questions about what he apparently views as dwindling judicial efficiency
noting that ``there are a lot more laws out there,'' scalia said, ``you simply cannot lay too much additional responsibility upon this institution (the federal courts) without fundamentally changing'' it
responding to a similar question by rep. jim kolbe, r-ariz., scalia said the caseload problem facing federal courts ``originates right here (in congress) and i don't see an answer to it.''
the united states and britain on tuesday vetoed a security council resolution to impose economic sanctions on south africa in an effort to end apartheid
the measure failed by a vote of 10-2, with france, west germany and japan abstaining
the resolution would have imposed mandatory worldwide sanctions, including an oil embargo, for a year
all the speakers deplored south africa's state of emergency and recent restrictions on anti-apartheid groups
in their speeches, the representatives of france and italy condemned pretoria's ban on activities by major anti-apartheid groups and urged dialogue between the white-led government and the black majority. however, the representatives did not endorse mandatory sanctions
the united states and some other western nations have opposed similar measures in the past. the five permanent members of the security council _ the united states, britain, china, france and the soviet union _ have veto power
the resolution proposed a ban on export and sale of oil to south africa, the discontinuation of iron and steel imports from south africa, an end to loans to south africa, a ban on sale of coins minted in south africa and a halt to all military, police or intelligence cooperation with south africa
in johannesburg, foreign minister pik botha said on national television that ``i wrote the words'' used by south africa's u.n. ambassador, leslie manley, last thursday when he told the council, ``do your damnedest.''
either we're strong enough to withstand and resist the onslaught against us or we're not,'' botha said
the draft resolution invoked chapter 7 of the u.n. charter, which provides for economic sanctions and other measures when international peace and security are threatened
last thursday the council opened a debate to condemn south africa's ban feb. 24 on activities by major anti-apartheid groups. it is expected to pass a resolution expressing outrage and condemnation
by law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services
four suspects in the killing of a rookie police officer as he sat in a patrol car were indicted tuesday, authorities said
todd scott, 19, scott cobb, 24, philip copeland, 22; and david mcclary, 22, were indicted on charges of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon, said richard piperno, spokesman for the district attorney's office
edward byrne, 22, was shot in the head feb. 26 as he sat in his car guarding the home of a man who had complained about crack dealing in the borough of queens
all four suspects have been held without bail since pleading innocent at arraignments friday and saturday
police commissioner benjamin ward said police believe a major drug dealer ordered the hit. the arrests followed a week-long investigation that included a roundup of 294 suspected dealers in queens
ward said the suspects met in a queens apartment feb. 25 to plan the murder of a police officer. police alleged that copeland was at the planning session, but not the slaying
it was not known who pulled the trigger. mcclary and scott have pointed the finger at each other, police said
he calls himself dee jay, says he is 17 and ran away from new york city. but beyond that, sheriff's deputies say they have no idea who he is or how to help him
this kid has been in limbo for 17 years _ or more. he doesn't know who he is or anything,'' montgomery county chief deputy gary haines said monday
haines appealed for public help to identify dee jay, saying routine missing-person checks and other leads have turned up nothing since the man was arrested outside a bar march 2
dee jay appears to have a severe learning disability, haines said. he also told investigators he may have been involved in pornography films and other abuse, haines said
dee jay was picked up after deputies were called to investigate a car burglar alarm outside a bar, haines said
his explanation is that he heard the alarm go off while he was in the lounge,'' said claudia marlin, the department's victim advocate. she said he was in the lounge because, ``they have free hors d'oeuvres and he was hungry.''
dee jay was not charged and is in the custody of the montgomery county children services board, haines said. he cannot read or use a telephone and can barely write, haines said
he is described as black, 6-foot-2, weighing about 150 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. he was wearing a black-and-silver sweater and washed jeans, haines said
dee jay told ms. marlin he lived with a man named rick in a three-bedroom apartment in the new york city borough of the bronx. he said he got occasional tutoring and once was treated by a doctor for the flu, she said
he said he hitchhiked from the bronx on a truck, ended up in dayton around christmas and slept in trucks and in doorways, ms. marlin said
the u.n. food and agriculture organization criticized the united states tuesday for its questions about how the agency handles its money and hires employees
fred j. eckert, u.s. ambassador to the agency, sent a letter to fao director-general edouard saouma seeking details of agency spending, hiring practices and saouma's compensation package
these are serious and important questions,'' eckert said tuesday
agency spokesman richard lydiker said: ``the director-general regrets that requests for information have been presented as aspersions on the management and reputation of the fao. as requests for information they are legitimate. but as aspersions they are groundless.''
throughout his entire term of office the director-general has scrupulously observed (the agency's) rules and regulations and this will be demonstrated in his reply to the permanent representative of the united states,'' lydiker said, reading from a statement
he also noted that the united states has not paid its contribution to the agency. lydiker said earlier this year that the united states owes $68 million from its 1986-87 assessment, which amounts to a quarter of the agency's budget
saouma, a lebanese, was elected to a third six-year term in november, defeating an african challenger supported by the united states and other major donor nations
the united states and other nations have called for reforms at the organization, which coordinates agricultural projects in developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the united nations
last november, a 1988-89 fao budget of $492 million was approved over objections from the united states, britain, australia and canada
in the course of our review, we have become increasingly concerned about reports portraying fao in an extremely unfavorable light. the questions that we shall be putting to you are for the purpose of getting at the truth of these matters,'' eckert said in his letter, dated march 3
the letter also asked for an explanation about travel expenses for delegates to a recent agency conference, the agency's purchase of cars and details of entertainment allowances
it asked how many former ambassadors were on the agency's payroll and whether relatives of current or former ambassadors work for the agency
winter wheat planted last fall for harvest this summer is in ``mostly good to fair'' condition in some of the nation's major production areas, a government report said tuesday
the joint agricultural weather facility said wheat during the week of feb. 29 through march 6 was not quite in such good shape in the northern great plains, delta and rocky mountain states, however
snow cover was virtually nonexistent in the central and northern great plain and rocky mountain states, but mild temperatures kept damage at a minimum,'' the report said. ``snow, preceding freezing temperatures, prevented severe winter damage to small grain (including wheat) in eastern kansas, northern oklahoma, illinois, missouri, indiana and ohio.''
crop development by early march ranged from greening in colorado to jointing of plants in mississippi and oklahoma, and heading in arizona, the report said
the facility is operated by the departments of commerce and agriculture. reports do not forecast actual production of crops, only the condition of fields and plants. organization to national coalition for haitian refugees.</note>
congress was urged by a trio of witnesses tuesday to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on haiti to spur a return to democratic rule
but the latin american director of the center for strategic and international studies, a washington-based conservative think tank, called on the united states to restore aid to haiti
the witness, georges fauriol, said the new government of haitian president leslie manigat ``deserves encouragement and resources _ rather than further sanctions and further hardship for the haitian people.''
barring gross misjudgment and behavior on the part of the new government, the united states, at a minimum, should reinstate the aid package cut off last november,'' fauriol said
but other witnesses disagreed
rep. george w. crockett jr., d-mich., chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs, said washington needs to make clear ``that the united states government will use every diplomatic, political and economic means at our disposal to help accomplish a free and fair election in haiti.''
a haitian journalist, raymond a. joseph, urged manigat to call new elections and order the investigation of politically inspired killings
michael s. hooper, executive director of the national coalition for haitian refugees, said the reagan administration would end the hope for free and fair elections in haiti if it moves to embrace the manigat government, which was installed after haiti's military forces broke up earlier presidential elections
the united states should immediately institute and recommend a complete (international) arms embargo and an end to all assistance that frees up domestic resources allowing the government to sustain the growing army,'' hooper said
patrick bellegarde-smith, an author specializing in haiti and its problems, called on the united states to continue the aid cutoff, to oppose all loans to haiti by international lending institutions, to withdraw haiti's privileges under the caribbean basin initiative, and to insist haiti restore democratic government and end the use of the country as a haven for narcotics trafficking
the congressional appropriations committees have denied a request by the energy department to shift $8 million to pay for evaluation of possible sites for the $4.4 billion super-collider atom smasher, the department said tuesday
we are looking at our options,'' department spokesman jeff sherwood said
the department is seeking $363 million in the fiscal year beginning oct. 1 to begin construction of the collider, a 53-miles-around tunnel that would smash beams of protons into each other
last year it requested $25 million for design and $10 million for early construction work that was not tied to a site, but congress approved only the $25 million
sherwood said the department had not sought site evaluation funds until it knew how many sites it would have to deal with. twenty-five states submitted proposals for 35 sites, a list that was narrowed to seven finalists in december
until recently the department had planned to write an environmental impact statement only for its final choice, expected to be made tentatively in july, but last month secretary john herrington told congress that choice would be delayed until november, and the department said it would assess environmental impacts for all seven sites
there is substantial congressional opposition to the heavy spending required for the project. sen. bennett johnston, d-la., chairman of the energy and natural resources committee and also of the energy and water development subcommittee of the appropriations committee, warned herrington that the department might not get all the money it was seeking in the new fiscal year
the $8 million would have been shifted from general administrative funds of the department for the current fiscal year
sherwood said the department could take evaluation funds from the $25 million, at the cost of slowing down design of the magnets that guide the proton beams, or could delay the evaluations, perhaps at the cost of pushing the site selection decision into the next administration
we would very much like to keep to our planned schedule,'' he said
rising production costs and a weakening dollar overseas are forcing the washington opera to raise ticket prices and reduce the number of performances next season, officials said tuesday. the best orchestra seats will sell for $60, up from $49.50 this year
despite the first major boost in ticket prices since 1981, general director martin feinstein said the opera still must raise $300,000 privately to stage a new production of giacomo puccini's ``tosca'' for its season opener in the kennedy center opera house on nov. 5
tenor placido domingo will star in that production, which will be directed by gian carlo menotti and conducted by rafael fruhbeck de burgos
other season highlights will include peter tchaikovsky's ``pique dame'' (the queen of spades), conducted by mstislav rostropovich and directed by his wife, galina vishnevskaya, and stephen paulus' ``the postman always rings twice,'' a 1982 musical adaptation of james m. cain's depression-era novel
the cheapest seats in washington will sell for $20 in the kennedy center's eisenhower theater, where smaller operas are staged, and standing room remains $10. students and senior citizens can still buy half-price tickets
feinstein blamed the increase on mounting production costs and a 50 percent decline in the value of the dollar abroad in the past three years, which makes it more expensive to hire domingo and other foreign singers
the budget squeeze also forced feinstein to reduce the number of performances from 66 to 48 next season and to present seven instead of the current eight operas
president reagan was asked tuesday to meet with the nation's civil rights leaders, who are trying to prevent a veto of legislation to restore full anti-discrimination protection to women, minorities, the handicapped and the elderly
the request came in a letter from the chairman and executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights, who said that reagan has rarely met with civil rights leaders during his seven years in office
now is the time for reconciliation, not for confrontation,'' said chairman benjamin l. hooks and executive director ralph g. neas, who asked for a meeting ``as soon as possible.''
the leadership conference includes all the major civil rights groups. there was no immediate white house response
reagan has threatened to veto the civil rights restoration act, which passed the house 315-98 and the senate, 75-14 _ margins large enough to override a rejection by the president
the civil rights leaders said the legislation would restore full federal civil rights protections in public and private institutions, and state and local governments receiving federal money. those protections were limited by a 1984 supreme court decision involving grove city college in pennsylvania
reagan, however, said the bill would actually expand federal jurisdiction beyond pre-grove city limits
hooks, head of the national association for the advancement of colored people, and neas, wrote reagan, ``contrary to what some have said, the restoration act is not an expansion of federal power.''
and they added, ``a presidential veto of a bill to end federal funding of discrimination would leave a terrible and lasting stain on your presidency.''
at the pike's landing bar, the regulars have a curious way of telling spring is near _ they wait for the first truck or car to break through the ice of the chena river
gary halmstad earned that dubious distinction monday. his 1979 van broke through 8 inches of ice as he started across an ice bridge used as a winter shortcut by many residents
i hate being this kind of harbinger of spring,'' he said
the ice cracked between the front and back tires, and he summoned a small wrecker to pull him off. instead, the tow truck pulled the front tires off a supporting shelf of ice, and the front of the van plunged into about 5 feet of water. he planned to call a larger wrecker to pull the van out the rest of the way
i'm glad it wasn't in the middle,'' he said. ``i suppose i should giggle. all i have to do is pay money for a tow truck and drain the engine.''

several california lawmakers are trying not to be spineless as they defend their decision to make the banana slug the official state mollusk
the state governmental orginization committee on tuesday endured slimy jabs about the slug, including comparisons to its garlicky cousin, escargot, before sliding the bill out of committee on a 12-2 vote
the legislation, authored by democratic assemblyman byron sher, now inches onto the assembly floor
sher introduced the bill at the urging of the dynamite blue bird troop of redwood city. six members of the inveterate invertebrate supporters testified before the committee and brought along six banana slugs
the state has several official mascots, such as the california gray whale as the marine mammal and the california dog-faced butterful as the state insect. but it has no mollusk, which is a large phylum of invertebrate animals that includes octopi, abalone, mussels, snails and slugs
blue bird susanna farley said the banana slug should be the state mollusk because ``they're native to the west coast and live in redwood forests, which is the state tree, and also they eat poison oak and that's very helpful.''
can we make escargot out of them?'' inquired assemblyman curtis tucker
i have no inherent objection to the state mollusk being such a useful, slimy, oozy thing,'' said assemblyman nolan frizzelle
assemblyman trice harvey tried unsuccessfully to make the state mollusk the abalone, saying they taste better and are not ``yucky yellow creatures that hide out in the mountains.'' two missiles fired at isfahan. pick up 5th graf: tehran radio...</note>

iraq said it fired two surface-to-surface rockets at isfahan in central iran in the first missile attack on that city in the nine-day-old missile duel. it said three missiles were fired into tehran and one at the holy city of qom
tehran radio said 12 civilians were killed when the missiles struck residential areas in the three cities, damaging houses, shops and a medical center
iraq has reported hitting tehran with 43 missiles since feb. 29 and iran says it has fired 23 into baghdad
iran said it fired a missile tuesday into amarah, an iraqi town halfway between baghdad and the southern port of basra, and two at mosul, an important northern oil center. iraq reported casualties but did not specify how many
iran has said 134 people have been killed and more than 300 wounded in the latest round of the ``war of the cities.'' iraq says there have been many civilian casualties, but has not mentioned figures
a dispatch from the official iraqi news agency said warplanes raided a ``very large naval target'' off iran. the phrase usually means an iranian supertanker
maritime sources said they had no information about the raid, which would be the first confirmed attack on a commercial ship in the gulf since feb. 12. more than 400 have been hit in the 7{ years of war
hashemi rafsanjani, speaker of iran's parliament, said the missiles being fired by iraq are soviet-made scud-bs, which previously have been used against iranian border cities
in order to increase the range of the missiles, they have been clumsily tampered with,'' he said. ``there is no doubt that the major powers did this, such as america or france.''
rafsanjani said iranian military experts had examined several unexploded missiles and concluded ``that although such missiles were originally made in russia, most of the eastern bloc countries manufacture or assemble this missile today, and iraq can obtain it from other sources.''
western military experts have said the missiles are scud-bs fitted with strap-on boosters enabling them to reach tehran and qom, which are nearly 300 miles from the border
the missile normally carries a 1,000-pound warhead and has a range of 190 miles. western experts say iran also uses scud-bs, supplied by its arab allies syria and libya, but it does not need boosters because baghdad is only 80 miles from the frontier
at the united nations in new york, soviet ambassador alexander m. belonogov told reporters monday the security council must act to prevent ``further escalation of the military conflict,'' but evaded a question about whether the kremlin would approve an arms embargo
u.s. ambassador herbert okun said a soviet resolution on the ``war of the cities'' should not ``undercut or erode'' council resolution 598 of july 20, which demanded an immediate cease-fire. throughout</note>
gallaudet university students on tuesday boycotted classes to protest the hiring of a hearing woman as the school for the deaf's next president, while a faculty leader said a growing number of instructors favor a deaf leader
the boycott of classes highlighted a second consecutive day of stormy protest over the hiring of elisabeth ann zinser, an administrator with the university of north carolina at greensboro who prevailed over two deaf finalists
at an afternoon rally at the school's football field, students burned effigies of zinser and board of trustees chairwoman jane bassett spilman. more than 1,500 students roared their approval in strong voices and flashing fingers
the rally highlighted a day in which most of the school's 1,800 undergraduate and graduate students skipped classes, and nearly a third of the school's 274 full-time professors did not show up to teach
i'm missing an art history test today, and my grades will probably be hurt,'' said 26-year-old eric spanbauer, a sophomore government major from decatur, ill. ``i'm not going to let my deaf rights get hurt. i've been waiting too long. this is our time.''
psychology professor neil reynolds, who chairs the school's 21-member faculty senate and a larger group that includes all the university's faculty, said a growing number of instructors are advocating a deaf president
there has been in the past week an escalation of overt support from faculty members for a deaf president,'' said reynolds. ``that is definitely a change.''
both the faculty senate and the larger group of instructors will meet wednesday to discuss the ongoing controversy, said reynolds
about 30 percent of gallaudet's professors are deaf, while nearly 22 percent of the school's support staff is deaf, according to university publicist barbara dennis
students took heart from the support from their mentors, and were cheered to know that alumni of the nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf were standing by them
the alumni sympathize with and support the students,'' gerald burstein, president of the school's alumni association, said at an afternoon rally. ``we _ unlike hearing members on the board _ know fully what it is like to be deaf. those members of the board who lack confidence in the abilities of deaf persons ... should resign.''
off-campus groups have also rallied behind the students
fred weiner, a washington spokesman for the national association of the deaf, said state leaders from his 20,000 member organization were planning to meet in washington on friday to discuss ways of helping students gain a deaf president
students say they will not stop their protest until zinser is replaced with a deaf president, spilman is replaced, and the university agrees to make deaf persons a majority on the school's 20-member board of trustees. the board now has just four deaf members
spilman said tuesday that the board will stand by its decision to hire zinser, vice chancellor of academic affairs at greensboro
it was not the intention of the board of trustees to create turmoil on campus,'' spilman said in a telephone interview. ``it was a vote cast in the best interests of the university, and elisabeth ann zinser was selected for one and only one reason _ she was the most qualified person.'' gm comment</note>
three federal appellate judges tuesday upheld a lower court's finding that there was no evidence general motors corp. knowingly sold 1.1 million 1980 x-cars with alleged brake defects
the panel of the u.s. circuit court of appeals in washington affirmed u.s. district judge thomas penfield jackson's 1987 rejection of government claims that the cars had an inherent defect that caused rear brakes to lock up prematurely and spin out of control under certain circumstances
jackson had ruled against the national highway traffic safety administration, which had sought to fine gm $4 million and order a complete recall of the 1.1 million 1980 models of chevrolet citation, pontiac phoenix, buick skylark and oldsmobile omega
the suit was filed in 1983 after the agency received more than 4,000 complaints from drivers that the cars spun out of control after the brakes had locked. without conceding there was a defect, gm had previously agreed to two recalls, which the government said were inadequate to deal with the problem
in its ruling tuesday, the appeals court rejected the government's argument that jackson had improperly rejected the testimony of drivers who said they believed the skidding was caused by defective brakes
we agree with the district court that the drivers were in no position to know if the rear-wheel lockup was, in fact, premature in view of the particular breaking application and driving parameters involved in each incident,'' the panel said in an opinion by circuit judge kenneth starr
drivers cannot assess with reasonable accuracy the external variables that may contribute to a skid, no matter how rich their experience or concentrated their attention may be,'' the court said
gm, in a statement released in detroit, said, ``today's decision more than justifies our determination to stay the course and defend the 1980 x-car through long and costly and highly-publicized litigation.''
the appeals court has given added assurance to the owners of 1980 and later models of the x-car that they may drive those cars with confidence,'' it said
the government did not have any immediate reaction to tuesday's ruling
in his opinion last april, jackson concluded that ``there is simply no engineering evidence of any peculiar property of the x-car generally that renders them in any way exceptional insofar as having a predisposition to yaw (turn).''
the appeals court panel also rejected the government's argument that jackson improperly considered gm test data that was taken after the case was filed
the government contended the test data was based on an insufficient sample of x-cars and ``peer cars'' that had similar brakes. this data demonstrated that x-cars were no more likely to skid than similar vehicles. it also showed that skidding of x-cars was not caused by a brake malfunction
it would have been odd for the district court to have dismissed all this data as irrelevant in assessing the probabilities that the vehicle, rather than other factors, was responsible for the mishaps,'' starr wrote in an opinion that was joined by judges harry t. edwards and douglas h. ginsburg
starr noted that ``over 300 x-cars, including 71 that had been the subject of consumer complaints, and 528 peer cars were run through the testing gauntlet. those impressive numbers stand in rebuke to the government's claim that an insufficient sample was used.'' assets, suit also filed in boston. picks up 7th graf pvs, `the suit...'.</note>
a federal judge temporarily froze panamanian assets in banks here after a suit was filed tuesday to prevent the government of strongman gen. manuel antonio noriega from withdrawing any funds
a similar order was issued last week in new york city, and a suit was filed tuesday in boston as well. a hearing in the boston suit was set for friday
the miami suit lists the republic of panama as the plaintiff and was set in motion by panama's u.s. ambassador juan b. sosa, who has refused to recognize the noriega government
the money at issue is ``a substantial amount,'' said sosa's attorney, mark a. cohen. but he refused to give a figure
u.s. district judge sidney arononvitz issued a temporary restraining issue late tuesday afternoon preventing the defendant banks from turning over any funds to noriega or his government's agencies. the judge scheduled a hearing on the order for 1:30 p.m. wednesday
defendants in the miami suit were the citizens and southern international bank, republic national bank of miami, barnett bank of florida and the boston-based bank of new england's international branch in miami
the suit says noriega, under indictment for drug smuggling in miami and tampa, illegally dismissed panama's legal president eric arturo delvalle on feb. 25
the suit states that delvalle consitutes the ``only lawful government of the republic of panama and that gen. noriega's regime is illegal.''
it said only sosa is authorized to withdraw money from the bank accounts, and seeks an injunction preventing the banks from making payments without his approval. confirmation, new details. corrects spelling of resistance. no pickup</note>
security forces crushed an attempted coup tuesday on sao tome and principe and killed two of the 40 armed raiders who landed in canoes in the marxist-ruled west african nation, a government official said
information ministry official joao carlos said most of the attackers were captured as they tried to seize national police headquarters on the coast of the former portuguese colony
one policeman was wounded and security forces were combing coastal areas for attackers still on the loose, portuguese radio reported from sao tome
carlos, speaking in a telephone interview with portuguese television, said forces loyal to the marxist government of president manuel pinto da costa were securing key facilities, including broadcasting stations and the airport
sao tome and principe lies about 125 miles off the west coast of gabon in the gulf of guinea. the two-island country, with a population of 110,000, has one political party, the sao tome e principe liberation movement
the portuguese radio report said the raiders boarded canoes from a larger craft that anchored offshore
president da costa appealed tuesday night for vigilance against attacks in a two-minute broadcast on national radio after an emergency cabinet meeting, reports said. he said calm was restored within hours of the landings on two beaches between 3 and 4 a.m
da costa blamed the attack on government foes linked to the national resistance front of sao tome and principe. portuguese tv said the raiders were suspected of launching the attack from gabon, where the front is based
the front's lisbon-based secretary-general, quintiliano loures amadao, denied it was responsible
he said the attack may have been carried out by dissidents within the front, or members of the sao tome and pricipe armed forces unhappy over the presence there of angolan troops
the two islands lie on strategic atlantic shipping lanes. news reports in 1984 said about 2,000 soviet and cuban troops ran two radio stations and a submarine facility in the area
rumors of an imminent invasion swept sao tome and principe in 1978 and cuba, angola and guinea-bissau sent troops to help defend the islands
the invasion never materialized, but the country has since strengthened its ties with angola, cuba and the soviet union. an estimated 1,000 angolan troops are stationed in sao tome and principe to support the regular army
the force supposed to be behind the invasion never was clear
the ruling party has not previously faced armed opposition. loures amadao said the resistance front supported peaceful dialogue with the government because it was in no position to engage in an armed struggle for power. plan</head>
secretary of state george shultz told a senior israeli envoy tuesday that he would reject any attempt by prime minister yitzhak shamir to postpone a response to his mideast peace plan, an israeli source said
shultz met for an hour with israel's former ambassador to washington, moshe arens, a close shamir confidante, said the source, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. the state department confirmed the meeting took place but declined to comment further
arens asked for the meeting following a letter sent last week by 30 senators to shultz urging that shamir cede israeli-occupied lands in return for peace with the arabs
the letter by some of israel's staunchest supporters on capitol hill caused consternation in jerusalem, which is unused to such censure from congress. shamir is expected to face heavy pressure from congress when he comes here for a four-day visit next week
shultz told arens that ``he sees no good reason why shamir cannot come here with an answer'' to the u.s. proposal which calls for negotiations on a three-year period of palestinian self-rule to be followed by talks on a permanent solution for the occupied west bank and gaza strip, said the source
shamir on sunday blocked a cabinet debate on the proposal, which shultz presented during a shuttle diplomacy swing through the region last week, but said he would bring the subject up for a decision after he returns from washington. shultz asked both israel and jordan for an answer within 10 days
israeli news reports say shamir will make shultz a counterproposal which will include self-rule for the 1.5 million palestinians under israeli control but will not address the question of the future of the territories
shamir and his right-wing likud bloc are opposed to a land-for-peace formula
the white house on monday welcomed the senators' call for shamir to give up arab lands, but the state department has not responded publicly. shultz is expected to answer the senators, possibly later this week
shultz told arens that ``israel can't afford to delay,'' especially in view of the growing congressional and public pressure for negotiations to resolve the israeli-palestinian violence which has resulted in the killing of some 80 arabs by israeli troops over the past three months
meanwhile, sen. chic hecht of nevada and several of his fellow republicans were working on a letter or statement in response to last week's letter to shultz. hecht, as well as sens. jesse helms of north carolina and arlen specter of pennsylvania, are opposed to what they view as internal interference in israeli politics
an organization formed to advise president reagan on jewish matters lashed out tuesday at 30 senators who wrote a letter supporting the administration's position that it is time for israel to exchange land for peace
the group, known as the national jewish coalition, said the senators ``operated in haste'' and were ``inserting themselves into the internal politics of israel.''
the group issued its statement after a meeting in the oval office with reagan. however, richard fox, the chairman of the organization, said the president did not discuss the peace process or the violence in the israeli-occupied territories
he said the meeting with reagan lasted only 12 or 13 minutes and the president's comments were ``really more of a ceremonial statement. there was no forum for discussion of the issue.''
the coalition, formed after the 1984 election, comprises jewish republicans
on monday, the white house had said it welcomed the senators' statement, in which they criticized israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and his likud party, suggesting they may be blocking efforts to reach a peace settlement in the middle east
asked about that letter, fox said, ``our belief is that those distinguished senators _ all of whom are friends of israel _ operated in haste.''
he complained that they based their criticism on a report in the new york times ``rather than direct statements from the prime minister.'' the letter had said the senators were dismayed to read in the newspaper that shamir had opposed giving up any territory, saying, ``this expression of territory for peace is not accepted by me.''
fox said the senators ``are dealing in an area which is very sensitive at this time and essentially inserting themselves into the internal politics of israel
there is obviously a debate going on between the two political parties in israel as to what their position should be and i think the best thing that we who are concerned and interested can do is to hopefully let the israelis develop their own position.''
he also said the organization was supportive of the middle east peace approach taken by secretary of state george p. shultz, but said much of details remain to be defined
construction has begun at an abandoned strategic air command base near ben guerir, morocco, to create an emergency landing site for space shuttles when they begin flying again, the national aeronautics and space administration said tuesday
the former sac base has a 14,000 foot runway, but its surface must be rejuvenated to make it usable by shuttles that for some reason they fail to reach the speeds necessary to get into orbit
the ben guerir base, 40 miles north of marrakech will be the fourth emergency site. nasa announced earlier in the week that another airport site in northwest africa, in the tiny country of the gambia, will be upgraded to accommodate shuttles. the space agency intends to continue using runways at zaragoza air base and moron air base in spain
foundations for shuttle approach and landing aids are being laid at the new sites and other equipment, including 10 personnel vehicles, will be shipped

high temperatures were expected to reach the 30s across the northern great lakes; the upper 20s and 30s across northern maine; the 40s from northern washington into western montana and from the eastern dakotas into southern new england; the 70s across southern california and arizona, the central gulf coast and the southern atlantic coast; the low 80s across much of florida and the desert southwest; and the 50s and 60s elsewhere. documents</head>
attorneys for lyndon larouche, six followers and five larouche political groups battled the government tuesday for access to classified fbi information concerning larouche and key players in the iran-contra scandal
several of the defense lawyers sought to dismiss the case after being denied immediate access to the information, but u.s. district judge robert e. keeton deferred ruling on the requests until after questions over access to the fbi files are resolved
defense attorneys, at hearings outside the presence of the jury, have presented evidence in recent weeks of fbi infiltration of larouche organizations
they also have gained access to a one-page memo from retired air force maj. gen. richard secord to marine lt. col. oliver north, the former national security council aide, in which secord reports ``our man here claims lewis has collected info against larouche.'' lewis was not further identified
the memo, found in north's safe after he was fired because of his role in the iran-contra affair, was surrendered to larouche defense lawyers after the special prosecutor investigating the scandal acknowledged its existence
secord, reached tuesday in washington, said he could not recall the memo and said he never had crossed paths with larouche. secord was one of north's principal operatives in his network of private aid to the contras
defense lawyers have said they will prove the reagan administration plotted to ruin larouche because he refused to support reagan's programs to aid nicaragua's contra rebels. they also argue that the government has improperly withheld evidence that could prove their case, which could be grounds for dismissal of the charges
they contend that north directed the fbi to gather information against larouche and infiltrate his organizations as part of a larger fbi surveillance of groups opposed to the administration's central american policies
larouche, the aides and organizations all are charged with conspiring to cover up alleged credit card fraud by larouche supporters during his 1984 presidential campaign. four of the organizations are charged with fraud. larouche is seeking the 1988 democratic presidential nomination, his fourth run for the white house. he faces up to five years in prison if convicted
prosecutors throughout the trial and pretrial hearings denied defense contentions that the government inflitrated larouche's organzations and concocted a credit card fraud and cover-up scheme to destroy larouche and his following
after learning of the may 1986 secord-north memo, defense lawyer michael reilly requested any information the government had about larouche and lewis that might be favorable to defense claims
the prosecutor in the case, assistant u.s. attorney john markham, surrendered documents from fbi files to reilly, but the fbi later told markham that he was not supposed to release the material
other defense attorneys now want copies of the documents, but the fbi opposed the request on grounds the records are classified. reilly, who represents just one of the five larouche organizations that are defendants, has said he cannot give the documents to his fellow defense lawyers because of federal rules on classified information
markham, as the government attorney in the case, normally would argue the fbi's position. but he refused to do so tuesday, saying there was a conflict of interest between the fbi's stance and his role as prosecutor of the case. he did not elaborate, but said the conflict would be resolved before the wednesday hearing on access to the records
keeton also told markham he wants an explanation as to why defense lawyers, through freedom of information act requests, have learned of the existence of thousands of other fbi documents mentioning larouche that were not turned over to defense lawyers before the trial
i've got to have some explanation from the government about how the documents are discoverable through foia requests and not by the prosecution,'' the judge said
after the questions over access to the records are resolved, defense lawyers have said they will renew their motions for dismissal of the case or a mistrial on grounds their opening statements and cross-examination strategies would have been different if they had reviewed the documents prior to trial
the governing christian democratic party on tuesday withdrew the candidacy for the national legislature of a member under investigation for alleged misuse of u.s. aid funds
rodolfo castillo claramount, vice president of the party, appeared before the central elections council to remove luis mejia miranda as a candidate for the national assembly in elections march 20
mejia is going to have support in order to clear up his personal situation, but we don't want the application of justice to be blurred if he is elected and possesses (legislative) immunity,'' castillo told reporters
assembly members have a degree of immunity from prosecution under salvadoran law
castillo called on the public prosecutor's office to conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations against mejia, which were reported sunday by the new york times
the newspaper said mejia is being investigated for allegedly misusing up to $2 million of u.s. aid
it quoted unidentified salvadoran and u.s. officials as saying it could be the largest case of theft of american aid money during the administration of president jose napoleon duarte, who was elected for a five-year term in may 1984
mejia on monday denied the allegations and said, ``can you imagine that if i had ($2 million) i would still be in this country?''
the new york times also said duarte's son alejandro, who is running for mayor of san salvador, was trying to protect mejia
alejandro duarte on monday denied having ties to mejia
according to the new york times, the money allegedly stolen was part of a $10 million program to assist war-ravaged areas and help win the support of salvadorans in the war against leftist rebels
it said mejia resigned three months ago as director of the national commission for the restoration of areas, but president duarte agreed to allow him to become a party candidate for the national assembly on the recommendation of alejandro duarte. involved in consulate assault, none of them embassy workers, britons charged.</note>
britain's foreign office summoned panama's ambassador tuesday after he hired a british security firm to seize the panamanian consulate from diplomats opposed to gen. manuel antonio noriega
the assault, in which seven men from the security firm used a land rover to smash through the glass doors of the consulate monday night, was condemned by prime minister margaret thatcher
differences of opinion should not be fought out on london streets,'' she told parliament
the foreign office said undersecretary tim eggar and panamanian ambassador guillermo vega ``had a full discussion of the incident and the background to it.'' it said foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe ``is now considering what the ambassador said.'' it did not elaborate
police announced tuesday night that the seven security men, all britons, had been charged with offenses against public order
consul eduardo arango and his staff had remained loyal to deposed panamanian president eric delvalle, who was ousted feb. 26 after he tried to fire noriega, the military chief and power behind panama's government
arango, who was not in the consulate at the time of the takeover, had been fired by panama's new government but refused to leave his post, saying delvalle was the legitimate president
it was ``a thuggish way of behaving and an unbelievable way of doing things in a civilized country,'' arango told a british broadcasting corp. television interviewer
vega, loyal to noriega, told reporters that the assailants had his authority and were ordered into the consulate ``because this place was full of outsiders to the panama government.''
police said seven men forced their way into the consulate and that six remained to occupy the offices. they said no one was injured
the seven security employees were questioned by police and after being charged they were released on an undisclosed amount of bail for an april 6 court hearing
police identified them as michael lord, 35, a security officer; james brown, 30, a company executive; robert green, 34, a security consultant; electricians thomas anderson, 34, joseph anderson, 39, and kenneth ford, 38, and construction worker kevin noble, 26. they worked for gb security

tennessee sen. albert gore jr. and vice president george bush cashed in on endorsements from kentucky politicians to easily win the state's democratic and republican primaries tuesday
gore, running in his neighboring state, defeated massachusetts gov. michael dukakis in the democratic race by 45,593 votes or 39 percent to dukakis' 26,902 votes or 23 percent, with 1,151 of 3,243 precincts or 35 percent reporting
jesse jackson was third with 20,509 votes or 18 percent; missouri rep. richard gephardt had 10,628 votes or 9 percent; former colorado sen. gary hart had 4,363 votes or 4 percent; and illinois sen. paul simon finished with 2,734 votes or 2 percent
in the republican primary, with 1,384 of 3,237 precincts or 43 percent reporting, bush soundly defeated kansas sen. bob dole by 36,887 votes or 58 percent to dole's 14,731 votes or 23 percent
former television evangelist pat robertson was next with 7,287 votes or 11 percent; new york rep. jack kemp had 2,278 votes or 4 percent; and former delaware gov. pete du pont finished with 339 votes or 1 percent
at stake were 55 democratic and 38 gop delegates
gore won a battle with dukakis for the support of gov. wallace wilkinson, who decided to go with a neighboring son of the south
he's one of us,'' wilkinson said
but dukakis wasn't giving up. he began running tv ads on friday and paid his first visit of the year to the state _ in louisville on sunday _ wooing undecided voters
bush had the support of sen. mitch mcconnell, a national campaign co-chairman, and the two gop representatives who endorsed
in a late february poll conducted by the louisville courier-journal, gore was the choice of 28 percent of democrats while dukakis was the favorite of 20 percent. hart was third with 10 percent while gephardt, jackson and simon were all in single digits. undecided voters accounted for 23 percent
the poll found bush preferred by 51 percent of likely gop voters. dole was the choice of 28 percent. undecided voters made up the third largest segment at 11 percent. robertson and kemp split the rest. on motive</head> `made your point,' cuts off further evidence on witness' motive. picks up 3rd graf pvs, `the 63-year-old...'. subs 11th graf pvs, `as craft...', to delete now-redundant first reference to gordon. may stand for ams.</note>
the judge presiding over gov. evan mecham's impeachment trial told mecham's lawyer tuesday that he had showed that the state's top lawman ``had a motive to testify against the governor'' and ordered him to move on to other topics
arizona supreme court justice frank x. gordon, who earlier fielded objections to questions focusing on the witness' sex life, said he would allow no further testimony on the personal life or motives of department of public safety director ralph milstead, a key witness against mecham on an obstruction of justice charge
you have made your point,'' gordon told attorney fred craft as he concluded a two-day cross-examination of milstead
you have established that director milstead had a motive for testifying against the governor,'' said gordon, ``that he had a high-paying job with more than a modicum of influence and with a number of perks.''
he said it was clear that mecham had planned to fire milstead and, ``presumably col. milstead wants to keep his job.''
but he said further evidence on the subject would be cumulative and time-consuming
he noted that the senate impeachment court could overrule his decision. but senators, who protested the slow pace of testimony was costing taxpayers $20,000 a day, went along with gordon
his ruling derailed an announced defense plan to call a parade or witnesses to challenge milstead's crediblity
this witness is the accuser of the governor ...,'' attorney jerris leonard told the senate shortly before gordon's announcement. ``what we are doing is asking questions to lay the foundation for future witnesses to impeach his credibility.''
prosecutor paul eckstein told reporters outside the hearing room that the judge's ruling will bar the defense from calling to the stand a woman who the defense claims was milstead's paramour
craft's questioning drew repeated protests from the prosecutors that he was using innuendo to delve into the sex life of milstead. the subject was ruled off-limits by gordon earlier
the 63-year-old governor, who has not attended any sessions of the impeachment trial since it began last week, is accused of ordering milstead not to help the attorney general investigate an alleged death threat to a grand jury witness by a mecham aide
the governor has acknowledged he may have given such instructions to milstead but says he was not fully informed about the situation. and milstead has said he cooperated with the attorney general's office
craft was interrupted several times by objections from house prosector william french as craft tried to delve into the relationship between milstead and a one-time dps informant christina juell johnston
milstead said they had a professional relationship, adding, ``i counted her as a friend.''
but he denied he escorted her on dates in his state vehicle or paid for her meals out of state funds
craft previously had asked, ``did you ever travel to mrs. christina juell johnston's home in your state vehicle?''
i believe i did, yes,'' said milstead
did you ever stay overnight at mrs. christina juell johnston's home with your state vehicle?'' asked craft. ``no, i did not,'' said milstead
as craft continued to pose questions about the relationship, asking if milstead paid for her meals at restaurants, french arose and addressed gordon
mr. presiding officer, this is cross-examination by innuendo. it's improper,'' said french
gordon noted that he had ruled out questions about milstead's alleged sexual affair as irrelevant. milstead, who is now divorced, was married at the time of the alleged affair, while mrs. johnston was single
but craft insisted he was merely seeking information about possible misuse by milstead of a state vehicle or possible improper listing of meals on his expense account, and gordon permitted the questions to continue
in other questioning tuesday, craft suggested that milstead purposely kept mecham in the dark about the investigation of the alleged death threat
but milstead insisted: ``the relevant information was in his hands
milstead acknowledged he never told mecham he was planning to disobey the governor's orders and take the case to the attorney general
i was in shock from his anger, ... his insistence we not cooperate'' milstead said. ``... he was not to be reasoned with
when his words were, `don't give them any help whatsoever,' i said, `ok' and that was the end of the conversation.''
asked whether mecham might have assumed that milstead was agreeing to obey his order to keep quiet, milstead said, ``he could have construed it that way, yes.''
in addition to obstructing the attorney general's investigation, mecham is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 in a state fund by loaning it to his car dealership
mecham, the first u.s. governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades, also faces a criminal trial march 22 on felony charges of concealing the campaign loan and a recall election may 17. with cotugno's version of incident, civil suit.</note>
retired investment banker arthur k. salomon admitted tuesday that he shot a college student after a traffic dispute, saying he was afraid the young man was going to attack him
salomon, 53, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault. he had been indicted on a charge of attempted murder
in return for the plea, state supreme court justice nicholas colabella indicated he would sentence salomon to two to six years in prison on april 27. salomon, grandson of one of the founders of the salomon brothers investment firm, could have received a maximum of five to 15 years in prison
salomon read a brief statement describing what happened june 19 when he shot gianluca cotugno, 19, of larchmont off the hutchinson river parkway in scarsdale, north of new york city
cotugno, who was hospitalized several weeks with a gunshot wound to the stomach, was not in court
salomon said he was heading south on the parkway from his pound ridge home to his manhattan apartment when a white honda began to tailgate him. the driver flashed his lights and ``attempted to run my car off the road,'' salomon said
salomon pulled off at an exit, and stopped his 1977 mercedes-benz. the honda also pulled off, salomon said, and the driver got out of the car
a tall, slim white male was moving rapidly toward my car, waving his arms in a threatening manner and shouting,'' salomon said. ``i believed at that time that this individual was going to attack me.''
the other man was unarmed, salomon said
salomon said he reached for a loaded .38-caliber colt revolver in the car
by then, the man was ``standing adjacent to the passenger door of my car. he was leaning over my car, making threatening motions with his hands. i believe he was going to attack me,'' salomon said. ``knowing that the revolver was loaded, i discharged it in the direction of the individual.''
salomon said that when he realized he had hit the man, ``i panicked and drove away.''
salomon, who had licenses for the colt and another gun, surrendered to authorities several hours later
cotugno told authorities that salomon was traveling slowly in the left lane and, despite his flashing his lights, salomon would not move to the right lane so that he could pass
salomon pulled over, waving for cotugno to do the same, cotugno said
cotugno said that when he approached salomon's car, he spotted the gun and told salomon he was going to get the car's license plate and call police. the shooting occurred after cotugno had started to walk back to his car
a $15 million civil suit cotungo filed against salomon is pending
divine, the bizarre female impersonator who starred in such films as ``pink flamingos'' and ``hairspray,'' was remembered tuesday by john waters, director of the two movies, as ``a kind and gentle man.''
divine is as irreplaceable to me as a member of my own family,'' waters said, reading haltingly from a statment at a baltimore hotel. ``i'll miss him incredibly.''
not only did i respect him as the best actor i've ever worked with, i knew him personally as a kind and gentle man,'' waters said
the 42-year-old actor, whose real name was harris glenn milstead, was found dead in his bed monday at the hollywood regency plaza hotel. waters said he was told divine was found under the covers ``with a smile on his face.''
a preliminary coroner's autopsy failed to pinpoint a cause of death, and a microscopic examination of tissue samples was ordered. preliminary tests showed no signs of trauma or any other factor that would have contributed to the actor's death, los angeles county coroner's spokesman steve stewart said tuesday
publicist john west of pmk said the actor apparently died of asphyxiation during the night. he was in town to appear in an episode of ``married ... with children,'' a fox television network series
divine normally slept upright, propped up because of his weight, said peter haas, a publicist for ``hairspray.''
divine had a long-term weight problem but was found at a medical checkup friday to be otherwise in excellent health, his manager, bernard jay, said tuesday
he was not on drugs at all, and he never drank alcohol,'' jay said. ``i suppose it all comes down to his weight. he was constantly trying to diet, but as soon as he'd take the pounds off, they'd come right back on again.''
waters was one of the actor's few friends in school in lutherville, a baltimore suburb, where milstead said he grew up fat and taunted by classmates
waters' obsession with trashy movies nearly matched milstead's fantasies of celebrity, and waters began casting his friend in bizarre roles
the most famous would be the cult film classics ``pink flamingos,'' ``lust in the dust,'' ``polyester'' and ``female trouble.''
he had been pleased over his role in ``hairspray'' as edna turnblad, the fat mother of a fat teen-age girl
he'd call me in the middle of the night to read me some newspaper interview and say, `isn't it wonderful! they called me divine, the 300-pound actor, not divine, the 300-pound transvestite,''' jay said
as divine, he wore garish makeup and was loud and foul-mouthed. ``she's her own person and a lot of people like that,'' he once said. ``the camp element is something out of the ordinary, this big man playing a sexy woman.''
milstead played a non-transvestite role, that of a sydney greenstreet-type character, in the 1985 film ``trouble in mind.''
besides film roles, milstead used the divine persona in a nightclub act
waters said that the last time he had spoken to divine was two days ago and that he had last seen him at the premiere of ``hairspray'' in new york city
in their last conversations, waters said, ``he was just so happy. he said `can you believe we came this far?''' shamir remarks on peace plan. picks up 7th graf pvs, ``the officers ... with minor editing. restores dropped words in 10th graf, ``in jericho ...</note>
arabs stabbed a man accused of aiding israel and dumped the corpse at his mother's door, and israeli gunfire killed another palestinian on tuesday, hospitals and witnesses reported
hundreds of arab women held demonstrations in the occupied territories, following a call for protests from the palestine liberation organization
hospital officials in nablus said three arab protesters were wounded by israeli gunfire, but the army said a jewish settler shot one of them after the settler's car was stoned in the balata refugee camp
residents of mazraa sharqiya said a settler shot khader mohammed hamideh, a 42-year-old businessman with seven children, outside his home. the army confirmed hamideh's death but said it was investigating the circumstances
according to u.n. figures, at least 83 palestinians have been killed by israelis since arab riots began dec. 8 in the west bank and gaza strip, which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war
prime minister yitzhak shamir indicated tuesday on israel television that he intends to debate u.s. peace proposals and to present his own plan when he visits washington next week
the u.s. plan calls for talks on a three-year period of palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories to be followed in december by negotiations on the permanent status of these territories
shamir said, ``this is only a proposal and we can certainly present our own proposals and make our comments.''
asked if he expects pressure in washington, the hardline prime minister replied, ``i don't expect any pressures and if there would be such they would not help.''
shamir opposes the u.s. plan because it calls for an international role in talks and because of its accelerated timetable
the daily hadashot said that shamir's plan calls for talks between u.s. and soviet representatives only. the superpowers would have a symbolic role and talks on a permanent solution would start three years after palestinian autonomy is implemented
in another development tuesday, the military command said four army officers were sentenced to 35 days in jail each for not being armed when three guerrillas commandeered their car before hijacking a bus monday
the officers were on their way to an army sporting event in track suits and fled when the guerrillas opened fire, the army said
three israeli hostages and the guerrillas were killed during the hijacking and later storming of the bus. the plo claimed responsibility.
more than 5,000 mourners attended the funerals of the slain israelis tuesday at beersheba in southern israel
in jericho, residents of the aqbat jaber refugee camp said palestinians killed an arab policeman suspected of collaborating, wrapped the body in a palestinian flag and dropped it at his mother's door
the army confirmed the body of nabil juma farah, 30, was found in the refugee camp monday night
it was the second killing of a suspected collaborator reported since violence began
police minister chaim bar-lev said he would encourage other arab policemen not to quit by raising their pay and trying to discover who killed farah
in mazraa sharqiya, 15 miles northeast of jerusalem, villagers said three israelis believed to be settlers stopped at a roadblock built of stones and trash bins and one shot hamideh, who owned a cafe and butcher shop
two of them got out and started to remove the stones. ... one of them got out and started to shoot,'' one witness said, speaking anonymously fear of reprisals
he said the settler fired at a home about 150 yards away then shot at hamideh's home next door, where the victim was standing
later tuesday, about 600 villagers chanting slogans and waving a plo flag carried hamideh's coffin through the village and buried him

washington (ap) _ a week of talks between u.s. and japanese officials over participation by u.s. firms in billions of dollars worth of japanese building projects ended in failure tuesday
and, a u.s. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said president reagan under the law could retaliate against japan for what are considered unfair trade practices
that is one of the options,'' the official said, adding that the reagan administration will decide probably by the end of next week what its next step will be
the official said the u.s. side had exhausted its capacity to resolve the issues and was not ready to go on talking, given the differences between the two sides
he said the japanese, who had offered measures to allow u.s. construction firms to gain experience in japan on seven projects, wanted discussions to continue
the u.s. delegation was led by j. michael farren, deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade. the japanese group was headed by peter sato, director general of economic affairs in the japanese foreign ministry
farren has criticized previous japanese proposals as offering american companies only limited experience, not enough to enable them to take part in normal japanese bidding on public projects
the u.s. official, as an example, cited the extension of the tokyo international airport at haneda, where he said the only opportunity offered to americans would be in ``compacting earth and laying concrete,'' and in building a monorail
the americans would not be competitive in the labor-intensive construction, he added. he said that under the japanese proposals they would not be allowed to participate in the design or engineering, nor in the building of a $900 million airport terminal
the official said the u.s. delegation also wanted the arrangements on participation by u.s. construction firms written into a formal agreement, while the japanese did not want to be bound and sought only a joint statement that unspecified arrangements were satisfactory
police used tear gas and water cannons on tuesday to scatter hundreds of demonstrators who turned an international women's day march into a protest against the military government
at dusk, police reported around 100 demonstrators detained, but reporters in santiago and other witnesses called that figure too low
demonstrators were also arrested in similar protests in valparaiso, 75 miles northwest of santiago on the pacific coast
the street protests were the first this year against the 14-year-old regime of gen. augusto pinochet
helmeted riot police in downtown santiago fought running battles for hours with protesters, most of them women
scattered repeatedly by police, the demonstrators would quickly regroup at a different intersection and renew their chanting of anti-government slogans
police used water cannons to put out flaming barricades erected by protesters
reporters saw a public bus set afire with gasoline bombs thrown by three people. the bus was destroyed, but all passengers fled without injury
the united nations declared march 8 as international women's day, but chile's government said leftist groups turned the day into a ``marxist event.''
tuesday's march was called by women's organizations and dissident groups
jesse jackson muscled out tennessee sen. albert gore jr. to win virginia's first presidential primary tuesday, while vice president george bush overwhelmed kansas sen. bob dole
in the democratic race, with 434 of 1,986 precincts or 22 percent reporting: jackson had 35,123 votes or 46 percent; gore had 18,797 votes or 25 percent; and massachusetts gov. michael dukakis had 14,743 votes or 19 percent
missouri rep. richard gephardt had 2,981 votes or 4 percent; former colorado sen. gary hart had 1,412 votes or 2 percent, and illinois sen. paul simon had 1,121 votes or 1 percent
in the republican race, with 432 of 1,986 precincts or 22 percent reporting: bush had 26,737 votes or 52 percent; dole had 12,009 votes or 23 percent; and virginia native pat robertson had 8,908 votes or 17 percent, and new york rep. jack kemp had 1,978 votes or 4 percent
the democrats were awarding 75 of virginia's 84 national convention delegates. no republican delegates were at stake after the virginia gop's central committee decided against a binding vote
virginia's 50 republican national convention delegates will be chosen at district and state conventions based on the outcome of local gop mass meetings and caucuses being held over the next two months, and robertson's supporters are expected to dominate those events
two weeks ago, backers of the former television evangelist from virginia beach overthrew long-time party activists in newport news by taking delegate seats to the district convention
an austrian foreign ministry official said tuesday that president kurt waldheim has accepted an invitation to visit kuwait and that austria would not bow to ``zionist threats,'' a news agency reported
the official kuwait news agency quoted ministry general secretary thomas klestil as telling it that waldheim received the invitation from the emir, sheik jaber al-ahmed al-sabah, ``with all appreciation and welcome'' and would visit ``at the earliest convenient time.''
it would be waldheim's second visit to an arab country following the world furor raised over his service in the german army during world war ii
kuna quoted klestil as saying that austria ``will not succumb to zionist threats and pressures to remove president kurt waldheim from his office.''
klestil is on a tour of persian gulf arab nations following a visit by iran's foreign minister, ali akbar velayati, to vienna, austria's capital
kuwait and neighboring noncombatant states are pressing for international efforts to convince iran to end its war with iraq, now in its eighth year
waldheim has visited jordan, the vatican and pakistan since his election
a supreme court panel on tuesday rejected a challenge to censorship powers that allow a cabinet minister to close newspapers for publishing material he considered objectionable
earlier, police detained nine journalists during an anti-apartheid demonstration by about 100 black women outside the chamber of mines building
police arrived about 10 minutes after the peaceful protest began. the crowd dispersed and police began seizing journalists, including crew members of cbs and london-based world television news
world television soundman prince msuthu said police punched him
police spokesman col. frans malherbe said the nine were were taken to police headquarters but were released without charge
malherbe said emergency rules that have been in effect for nearly two years prohibit members of the media from being at the scene of unrest
the protesters, members of the federation of transvaal women, called on mining companies to oppose new government restrictions on anti-apartheid organizations. the women's federation is an affiliate of the united democratic front, one of 18 organizations covered by the ban issued feb. 24
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate services
the censorship ruling by the rand supreme court could lead to the closing of the weekly new nation, a newspaper published for black readers by the south african catholic bishops conference
during the hearing, home affairs minister stoffel botha said he had been ready to shut down the new nation in january. he said the paper published material that he felt promoted outlawed organizations, fanned revolt and incited hostility toward security forces
under a decree issued in august by president p.w. botha, the home affairs minister can install censors at newspapers or shut down the publications
in its challenge, the new nation said the decree was unenforceable because editors could not anticipate what the minister might consider objectionable
gabu tugwana, acting new nation editor, said in a telephone interview, ``the paper we are putting out for tomorrow could be the one before the last issue.'' he said the publishers intended to appeal the decision
new nation editor zwelakhe sisulu has been in detention without charge for more than a year
under the emergency decrees, the home minister is not required to give detailed reasons for his objections to published material
the head of the three-judge panel said in the ruling the president was ``legally correct'' to give the minister such power. this year</head>
the death of a 3-month-old boy in a home fire brought to seven the number of small children killed in residential fires this year, authorities said
n.e. wallace, an assistant city fire marshal, said the latest victim, christopher bolden, died monday in a fire apparently caused by an electrical short circuit
the boy's 6-month-old cousin, jessica baker, suffered smoke inhalation and was listed in critical condition tuesday in le bonheur children's medical center
wallace said three children from 1 to 3 years old died in residential fires in memphis last year. so far this year, seven youngsters age 6 or less have died
when the latest fire broke out, christopher was one of five children being cared for at a house by one of his aunts. the woman managed to escape from the house with three of the children, ages 21 months to 4 years, and firefighters saved jessica
the family was out front screaming that there were kids inside,'' said firefighter ron chastain. ``there was an awful lot of smoke, and as soon as we got the door open, a lot of fire shot out.'' community'</head>
pat robertson's poor showing in the super tuesday voting in the south shows that ``the traditional value community has been totally fractured,'' the chairman of christian voice said tuesday night
frankly, i'm surprised that he did not do better,'' said robert grant, who leads the largest conservative evangelical lobby in the country
in early returns, robertson did not come in better than third in any state, behind vice president george bush and sen. bob dole of kansas. he bested another conservative, rep. jack kemp of new york, however
grant said the opinion-makers on the far right of the republican party must now try to come to some consensus on who they will back
only as this community hangs together does it have any real impact,'' grant said. ``the traditional value community has been totally fractured with kemp taking a piece, robertson taking the charismatics to a degree and a large part going to dole and bush.''
he said the vice president's showing in the south ``is an indication that he may be a viable candidate for the bible belt-type vote, but he is going to have to work for it.''
however, said grant, ``the image or perception conveyed by the bush campaign has been to savage and to turn away conservative christian activities. this has not necessarily been the sentiment of the vice president but it has been the impression conveyed within his campaign and among many established republican types
if bush wishes to woo that vote, he has a good shot at it.''
a teen-ager who admitted plotting the fatal beating of a classmate in 1986 has not suffered from severe psychosis or hallucinations despite a history of behavioral problems, medical experts said tuesday
the norfolk superior court jury is expected to hear closing arguments then begin deliberations wednesday, the seventh day of the trial
rod matthews, 15, of canton is being tried as an adult for murder in the nov. 20, 1986, slaying of 14-year-old shaun ouillette, also of canton, who allegedly was lured to a wooded area by matthews and beaten with a baseball bat
matthews, who pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, said he had plotted the slaying for a month to experience what killing someone was like, according to testimony from two classmates to whom matthews showed the body
dr. michael annunziata, a court-appointed psychiatrist, told a norfolk superior court jury that matthews suffered from a ``conduct disorder'' but that he had not experienced classic symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations
matthews, said annunziata, had ``substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirement of law.''
annuziata on tuesday said the methodical planning of the killing did not indicate psychotic tendencies but suggested matthews was ``playing by different rules.''
earlier, dr. marcel kinsbourne, director of behavioral neurology at the eunice shriver center in waltham, testified that standard doses of ritalin, a drug matthews had been taking, should not trigger violent behavior
ritalin, a stimulant primarily used to control hyperactivity in children, has been a key aspect of the case
the defense had contended that matthews was a mentally ill youth from a troubled home and that his problems were exacerbated by the use of ritalin
dr. bernard yudowitz of belmont's mclean hospital said on monday that ritalin may have made it harder for matthews to control his behavior
vice president george bush cruised to an easy victory in tuesday's presidential primary, while favorite son albert gore jr. blasted past other democrats to win his home state
in the republican race, with 195 of 2,391 precincts or 8 percent reporting: bush had 10,747 votes or 61 percent; kansas sen. bob dole had 3,600 votes or 20 percent; former tv evangelist pat robertson had 2,121 votes or 12 percent; and new york rep. jack kemp had 894 votes or 5 percent
in the democratic race, with 202 of 2,391 precincts or 8 percent reporting: gore had 34,449 votes or 76 percent; jesse jackson had 7,345 votes or 16 percent; massachusetts gov. michael dukakis had 1,537 votes or 3 percent; and missouri rep. richard gephardt had 761 votes or 2 percent
gephardt was an early campaigner in tennessee, but since gore announced his candidacy in june, jackson has been the only other democrat to visit the state
gov. ned mcwherter, gore's southern campaign chairman, conceded that jackson was supported by most blacks, who constitute about 18 percent of the state's voters
dole and robertson targeted bush as the man to beat in tennessee. robertson was in the state three times since jan. 1 and has been represented by his wife twice. dole, who visited the state six times since last year, spoke in knoxville on march 1
robertson and bush visited upper east tennessee, republican territory, in the 10 days before the election. kemp was in knoxville on sunday, where he said he would reassess his future in the race after tuesday
gov. michael dukakis and vice president george bush romped to super tuesday victories in their home state of massachusetts, a delegate-rich field that was virtually abandoned as the candidates rushed south
in the democratic race, with 50 of 2,140 precincts or 2 percent reporting, dukakis had 6,594 votes or 60 percent; jesse jackson had 2,567 votes or 23 percent; missouri rep. richard gephardt had 776 votes or 7 percent; tennessee sen. albert gore jr. had 332 votes or 3 percent; illinois sen. paul simon had 277 votes or 3 percent
on the republican side, with 49 of 2,140 precincts or 2 percent reporting, bush had 1,690 votes or 57 percent; kansas sen. bob dole had 789 votes or 27 percent; new york rep. jack kemp had 200 votes or 7 percent; and pat robertson had 148 votes or 5 percent
dukakis, the popular three-term governor of this liberal state, was a prohibitive favorite in the democratic primary, where 98 delegates were at stake, the party's third-biggest prize of the day
in the republican primary, 52 delegates were at stake, the fourth-biggest batch on super tuesday
bush carried massachusetts in the 1980 gop primary _ over ronald reagan _ and enjoys the support of many mainstream republicans. bush, who held a rally at historic faneuil hall last week, is the only republican candidate to visit the state since the new hampshire primary, although dole has sent his wife, elizabeth, for two campaign stops
in recent days, the bush and dole camps dueled with endorsements. bush was backed by former u.s. attorney general elliot richardson, dole by former sen. edward brooke
police swinging clubs dispersed hundreds of warsaw university students who marched for more academic freedom on tuesday, the anniversary of 1968 student protests
in the southern city of krakow earlier tuesday, riot police clashed repeatedly with student demonstrators and briefly detained 70-100 people, an opposition spokesman said
twenty years ago, march 8, 1968, police and communist party activists brutally attacked warsaw university students who were protesting censorship and political repression
this year's protests reflected a renewed campaign by student activists for legalization of the independent students union, or nzs. it was outlawed after the independent labor federation solidarity was suppressed with the declaratrion of martial law in december 1981
about 500 students chanting ``register nzs!'' and ``solidarity!'' and carrying banners began marching after an evening mass attended by about 2,000 people at st. anne's, a roman catholic church near warsaw university
riot police blocked the street 100 yards from the church, keeping demonstrators away from a monument to adam mickiewicz, the 19th century polish national poet
an nzs leader asked police to allow people to lay flowers at the monument. after demonstrators refused an offer to let a three-person delegation approach the monument, police charged the crowd, flailing with clubs. students fled
hundreds of people lining the sidewalk chanted ``gestapo! gestapo!'' police pushed several students and at least one middle-aged woman into vans, but how many people were detained could not be determined
at krakow's jagiellonian university, about 700 students tried to march to the main square in the city's old town and were blocked by riot police, said zygmunt lenyk, a krakow opposition activist
quoting accounts from witnesses, he said police attacked the crowd with clubs but about 50 demonstrators pushed through police lines to the square, where they were detained
lenyk said most of the students returned to campus and tried twice more to march to the square, about 500 yards away, but police attacked each time
students erected a street barricade with park benches and garbage cans but police vehicles drove through it, he reported
about 70 to 100 people were detained but police began releasing them by early afternoon, he said. lenyk reported at least three people severely beaten by police
in 1968, police and party activists went onto the warsaw university campus to beat and arrest protesters, many of whom were expelled, and a purge of reform-oriented intellectuals and jews followed. last week, the communist party said the purge was excessive
king hussein has invited yasser arafat, chairman of the palestine liberation organization, to amman to discuss the latest u.s. proposals on middle east peace, a government official said tuesday
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the invitation ``comes within a framework of a united arab stand'' reached at the arab summit in amman last year
secretary of state george p. shultz explained the proposals on trips to the region before and after last week's nato summit in brussels
in tunis, the central committee of arafat's fatah guerrilla group said tuesday the shultz plan was ``nothing but a desperate attempt aimed at reviving the (1982) reagan initiative and imposing it on the region.''
cbs news, in a report from paris, said, ``cbs news has learned that the american ambassador to the united nations, vernon walters, met secretly with a top-ranking plo leader in tunisia last weekend. this according to senior plo officials who say the meeting took place at a private home at a seaside resort near tunis.''
plo sources say it probably had to do with how palestinians can participate in any future peace talks,'' the report said, and added walters denied he had met with the plo. ``in a statement read by a spokesman, walters said he had no authorization to meet with them and had not done so,'' cbs news said
in washington, state department spokesman charles redman said reports that walters met with plo representatives were ``absolutely untrue.''
the u.s proposals include limited self-rule for the 1.5 million palestinians living in the israeli-occupied west bank and gaza strip and an international peace conference that could include the five permanent members of the u.n. security council, israel, jordan, syria and palestinians, but not the plo
hussein and arafat decided in 1985 to take a joint approach to peace with israel, but hussein called it off in february 1986, accusing arafat of not keeping his promises
on monday, jordan's minister of information welcomed the u.s. peace effort and said the shultz proposals were being ``studied thouroughly with arab states.''
we welcome the american moves, and we believe that the american re-engagement in the peace process is positive,'' hani khasawneh told reporters
a class action suit filed on behalf of five illegal aliens tuesday challenges provisions of the government's amnesty program that would bar hundreds of aliens from obtaining legal residency
the suit, filed in u.s. district court, seeks to block u.s. immigration and naturalization service rules concerning aliens who do not meet some of the requirements for legalization but whose illegal status was ``known to the government.''
ins rules under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 provide amnesty to aliens who lived illegally in the united states before jan. 1, 1982 as well as to agricultural workers who can prove they lived in this country for at least 90 days in the year ended may 1, 1986
a problem has arisen over individuals who arrived legally _ with a visa _ but who remained in the country illegally after the jan. 1, 1982 cutoff date, according to debbi sanders of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights, one of the attorneys for the plantiffs
in cases like these, the statute grants amnesty to those whose illegal status was ``known to the government.''
volunteer agencies helping illegal aliens have sought to use social security and internal revenue service forms to prove that aliens in this category were known
the ins, however, maintained that ``known to the government'' meant known to the ins, sanders said, noting that this difference of interpretation disqualified hundreds of illegals
intrepretation of those four words is the basis for the suit filed by the lawyers' committee, the new york american civil liberties union, the hispanic national bar association and a washington law firm
it if filed on behalf of five unidentified aliens and four volunteer agencies: ayunda inc., the ethopian community center, the latin american youth center and the mexican american legal defense and educational fund
i think the government has taken too narrow of view of what the statute calls for,'' said doris meissener, acting immigration commissioner 1981-82. ``it is quite clear that the government is much more than ins.''
ins spokesman duke austin said, ``basically `known to the government,' means known to us ... and known that there was an illegal status.''
troops took over plants of the state petroleum company tuesday and arrested labor leaders in response to a strike that threatens to paralyze transportation and the industrial sector
the government began rationing gasoline and motorists waited hours in line. many buses and taxis in major cities stayed off the streets for lack of gasoline, tranport unions said
police in santa cruz and la paz rounded up leaders of the petroleum workers union. the government declared the strike illegal and said there would be more arrests if the walkout continues
the conservative government decided to take over petroleum plants and gasoline distributorships after the petroleum workers union rejected a 30 percent wage increase conditioned on their not striking for a year
the santa cruz refinery, 350 miles east of la paz, was surrounded by army units after workers turned off the plant's machinery following the breakdown of negotiations with the government
the plant produces 70 percent of the gasoline and natural gas used domestically. it also is responsible for much of the natural gas exported to argentina, the country's principal source of export earnings
saul soliz, leader of the petroleum workers union, said the government's linking of a wage increase to a promise of no strikes is ``a maneuver to divide the labor movement against the interests of workers.''
the union accused the government of planning to finance the 30 percent wage increase with the firing of 1,500 workers. minister of energy fernando illanes denied the charge. the government-owned petroleum company employs 7,000 workers
the ministry of information said the military intervened to prevent the destruction of equipment and guarantee a supply of fuel
many factories in la paz and other cities said they had enough fuel for only two more days and were cutting back on production
the government will not negotiate under pressure, more so since 11 out of 21 unions agreed to the wage increase,'' said illanes. seemed</note>
vice president george bush marched across the south on tuesday, overwhelming sen. bob dole as he headed for a near-sweep in super tuesday voting. dole braced to absorb the shock and the campaigns of the two remaining republican presidential contenders were dealt shattering blows
tuesday's voting seemed likely to bury the struggling campaigns of rep. jack kemp and pat robertson, who had claimed the south as his base of support
bush won decisive victories throughout the region, capturing more than 50 percent of the vote in many states, including delegate-rich florida
he also scored big wins in tennessee, kentucky, georgia, alabama, virginia, mississippi, north carolina and massachusetts
dole had pinned his southern hopes on north carolina, the home state of his wife, elizabeth.
abc and nbc also projected the vice president as winning texas and maryland
dole had hoped to pull out a win in north carolina, the home state of his wife, elizabeth
however, early returns showed the senate minority leader to be ahead in only one state _ missouri, which borders his home state of kansas
at stake tuesday were 712 delegates to the republican national convention. virginia was alone among the 17 gop contests holding a ``beauty contest'' that awards no delegates
bush's national campaign chairman, lee atwater, predicted that bush would pick up more than 600 of those delegates _ a gain that would give him a near-unassailable lead toward winning the gop presidential nomination
i would certainly hate to be in sen. dole's shoes after tonight and especially if he loses in illinois,'' atwater said. battered in tuesday's voting, dole turned his sights to next week's illinois primary in hopes of staging a comeback in midwestern and western states
dole said earlier in springfield, ill., ``if we take a little bath today, i am going to start my road to recovery in illinois just like i did 40 years ago.''
dole was referring to his recovery in an illinois hospital from wounds suffered during world war ii
kemp and robertson were far outdistanced by bush and dole. kemp trailed robertson in most southern states, and was expected to drop out by week's end. for robertson, the voting throughout the south was a replay of his third place finish in saturday's south carolina primary, when he could muster no more than about 20 percent of the vote
robertson seemed less likely to abandon his dogged pursuit of the presidency at this time. but the former television evangelist conceded in advance that ``it would take some miracle'' for him to beat bush
bush voted in houston, and then told reporters, ``if we exceed our expectations or live up to them, i think we'll be in good shape.''
top campaign aides had said earlier that they thought bush stood a good chance of winning at least 12 or 13 states
polls showed the vice president ahead in 16 of the 17 contests, including those in delegate-rich texas and florida. his chief rival, dole, was ahead only in missouri
it's going to be a little tougher as we go along, but i've been in tough fights before,'' dole acknowledged at a morning news conference in kansas city, mo
he then traveled to illinois and immediately challenged bush to a series of debates _ ``one-on-one, without moderator'' _ in that state, which holds its primary next tuesday
bush's chief spokesman, pete teeley, scoffed at the idea when asked about it in texas
if bob dole was so serious about debating, he would have shown up for the (feb. 19) dallas morning news debate,'' teeley said. ``we have a strategy which has been highly successful and we plan to pursue it, and that doesn't include having one-on-one debates with bob dole.''
dole campaign strategists had conceded in advance that super tuesday would likely belong to the vice president
in fact, the question appeared to be not whether bush would emerge the victor, but by what kind of margin _ and whether the drubbing would be fatal to dole, who finished first in the iowa caucuses but lost strength in the ensuing contests
the dole campaign had sought to keep bush from picking up more than 500 delegates tuesday
dole, though, was looking ahead to illinois, where he promised to ``issue a challenge or two'' to bush
the senate majority leader, a 1984 presidential contender and gop vice presidential candidate in 1976, was reportedly spending $500,000 on television advertising in the state
a defeat there could all but end dole's presidential efforts and a strong showing for the kanasan was by no means assured. bush is backed by illinois gov. james thompson and 93 of the state's 102 republican county chairmen
kemp, dead last in the south carolina primary last weekend, had not been expected to see that flagging effort revived in tuesday's voting. aides said the new york lawmaker and former pro-football star would reassess his race later in the week. he was expected to pull out
robertson's chances as a serious contender seemed likely to be all but ended if his losses in super tuesday states were as decisive as his third-place finish in south carolina, where he won only 19 percent of the vote
robertson's candidacy came to life with his strong second-place finish the iowa caucuses on feb. 8. but in the primaries that followed, his strength ebbed
even so, he told a north carolinia campaign audience as recently as monday: ``we will do very well in the south.'' race</head>
super tuesday belonged to george bush, an avalanche of southern votes propelling him into an all but insurmountable lead in the race for the republican presidential nomination
one month to the day that the vice president was humiliated in the iowa precinct caucuses, his candidacy devastated by a third-place finish behind bob dole and pat robertson, bush was in command of the gop race
his campaign manager, lee atwater, predicted bush would pick up about 600 of the 712 gop delegates at stake on super tuesday
what happened?
on feb. 9, few could resist writing bush political obituaries. dole flew to new hampshire with a claim to momentum that seemed likely to carry him to a second straight victory
i think the vice president's campaign is over,'' said pete du pont
the hemorrhaging of george bush has begun,'' said al haig
those assessments proved premature
it was du pont whose campaign was soon over; haig who didn't even make it to new hampshire primary day
attempts to explain how the race turned around so quickly are likely to center on whether bush recovered or dole blew it
for five days, dole looked like a winner in new hampshire. then came the ``straddle'' ads, bush campaign commercials that portrayed the kansas senator as waffling on taxes, the single most sensitive political issue in new hampshire
the ads ran all weekend before the primary and there was no response from the dole campaign
too late, dole realized what had happened. his surge in the polls leveled out. suddenly, as voters began making up their minds just before the primary, bush began to gain
when the returns came in the vice president had won by 9 points and an angry dole appeared on television and snapped that bush should ``stop lying about my record.''
but there was more to bush's comeback than effective commercials
the vice president also changed his campaign style. he eschewed the cautious speeches _ the attempts to be vice presidential _ that had marked his iowa campaign. he drove a fork-lift at a lumber yard and an 18-wheeler at a truck stop
this is the real me,'' he proclaimed to more than a few snickers
whoever it was, he went over better with new hampshire voters than he had with their iowa counterparts
but, possibly the most important factor in the bush comeback was ronald reagan, the man bush had served as a totally loyal vice president for seven years
in iowa, identification with reagan, the president blamed for a devastated farm economy, was not an asset. voters wanted to send a message to the white house and they chose dole as their messenger
but in new hampshire, with an economy that had boomed since reagan took office, the president was enormously popular. the same was true in the south
the calender had shifted to bush's advantage
might it now shift back to give dole a boost? the next big contest is the illinois primary, a midwest state, the region where the kansas senator has trounced bush in three contests _ iowa, south dakota and minnesota
while campaigning tuesday in springfield, ill., dole said, ``if we take a little bath today, i am going to start my road to recovery in illinois just like i did 40 years ago.'' it was a chicago physician who guided dole's recovery from world war ii wounds

two survivors of the nov. 15 continental airlines crash at denver's airport told investigators tuesday that they thought they saw ice and snow on the wings as the dc-9 took off in a swirling snowstorm, but a pilot on another plane said the continental jet looked clear
moments after takeoff, the jet flipped over, hit the runway and broke into three pieces, killing 28 people and injuring the other 54 people aboard. some victims were trapped in the wreckage for more than six hours
wes zimmerman, a continental pilot on a neighboring plane that day, and crash survivors dr. fred helpenstell, 56, of nampa, idaho, and gregory wadsworth, 22, an airman stationed in idaho, were among 29 witnesses scheduled to testify at the national transportation safety board hearing, which opened tuesday
de-icing and the pilots' experience flying dc-9s were the chief issues raised during early testimony, although government officials have said their inquiry is not focusing on a single possible cause
zimmerman, whose continental 727-300 aircraft was on the 35-l runway at the same time as the continental jetliner, said he saw no ice or snow buildup on flight 1713
i felt good about how my de-icing was holding up,'' he said, explaining that he looked at nearby aircraft to gauge the condition of his own plane. but he acknowledged that his plane did not sit for as long between de-icing and takeoff as the ill-fated plane had sat
robert benzon, the ntsb investigator in charge of the inquiry, said during his opening statement that officials want to know why 24 minutes elapsed between the time flight 1713 was de-iced and the time it took off. other planes on the runway were taking off 15 minutes after being de-iced, he said
the reasons for flight 1713's 24-minute delay and the possible effects of snow or ice buildup on the wings and tail surfaces of the airplane during this delay are items of interest during this hearing,'' benzon said
in addition, the pairing of the two flight officers aboard flight 1713 would be discussed during the hearing, he said
capt. frank zvonek, 43, who had 198 hours on a dc-9 with only the previous 33 hours as captain; first officer lee bruecher, 26, had 36 hours piloting dc-9s and was flying the plane at the time of the crash. both men were killed
the pairing of two pilots with such experience in an aircraft type will be discussed during this hearing,'' benzon said
helpenstell, who suffered broken ribs and a broken finger in the crash, told the board that during takeoff from stapleton international airport he noticed that a wing looked wet
i wondered at one point, `is that ice?''' helpenstell recalled, ``but i decided it was just wet.''
wadsworth, who is stationed at mountain home air force base in idaho, said he had a clear view of the left wing
it had started to snow a lot harder, and it made me real nervous. it was like the snow was starting to pile up (on the wings),'' he said. ``i was very concerned, but i said it under my breath. i figured they do it (taking off in snowstorms) every day, and i was hopeful they would be able to do it this time. but unfortunately, that was not what happened. it was bad place.''
continental officials criticized wadsworth's testimony during the hearing, noting that he had lost a certification as an air force mechanic. wadsworth said he had been temporarily removed from mechanic duty because he had suffered flashbacks of the accident while he was on duty. he now works in a tool room
zimmerman, who had flown a dc-9 from june 1985 to february 1987, testified that before shortly before the stapleton crash, light to moderate snow was falling, not enough to affect safety
he said snow accumulation on his aircraft was ``very light. it was a cold snow, not a wet snow. it didn't build up on the flat surface of the wing.''
he testified that continental does not require pilots to have planes de-iced, but leaves it to the pilots' discretion. he estimated the time between the de-icing of his plane and takeoff at 17 to 18 minutes
under questioning by federal investigators, zimmerman said that if he had had to wait five minutes longer for takeoff, he would have re-evaluated whether his plane needed de-icing
flight attendant kelly englehart, 35, testified she was concerned when she learned that bruecher would be flying the plane. she and helpenstell also gave conflicting versions of the direction in which the aircraft rocked before it crashed
helpenstell said the plane rocked first to the right side on which he was seated and then came back suddenly to the left. englehart said the dc-9 rocked first to the left side and then sharply to the right
we felt the wing must have hit then. there were three large pops and a large explosion. i saw a large, orange fireball at the front of the cabin moving down. i shut my eyes and waited for it to be over. i waited for it to get me,'' she said. update with more rioting, two injured, bomb found in northern ireland. pick up 9th graf: prime minister...</note>
spanish police found an explosives-laden car tuesday that was believed rented by three ira members shot dead in gibraltar by british commandos, officials said
it was packed with powerful explosives made in czechoslovakia and rigged with a timing device set at 11:20 a.m., but the timer had not been connected, the spanish officials said. the white ford fiesta was in a parking lot at marbella, about 50 miles up the coast from this british colony
british officials in london said the irish republican army members, who were unarmed when commandos killed them sunday, had planned to detonate a car bomb tuesday during the 20-minute changing of the guard ceremony at the governor's residence. the ceremony began at 11 a.m
the royal anglian regiment now guards the convent, as the residence is called. the regiment was just transferred from northern ireland, where guerrillas of the mainly roman catholic ira have been fighting since 1969 to oust the british and unite the province with the predominantly catholic irish republic. protestants outnumber catholics about 3-2 in the province
soldiers patrolled convent square on tuesday and the ceremony went on as scheduled
all three of the ira members were from west belfast in northern ireland
in catholic west belfast, protesters outraged at the killings battled police and british troops throughout the day tuesday. at least two people were injured
police in northern ireland also reported a 1,600-pound explosive device was found in a hedge near the killeen customs post between newry and the town of dundalk in the irish republic and was defused
bands of youths in west belfast hurled gasoline bombs and rocks at security forces, hijacked vehicles and burned them, set fire to a lumber yard and erected barricades
they scattered as police and soldiers fired plastic bullets, but quicly reorganized
belfast police said a man's face was burned when his car was set afire and a woman was treated at a hospital for injuries suffered when her car was stoned
prime minister charles haughey of the irish republic held a special cabinet meeting. he told parliament later his government recognized britain's right to take reasonable measures against terrorism, but added:
we are greatly perturbed at the shooting dead of three unarmed irish people in circumstances where it appears from reports that they could have been arrested by the security forces. the law shouldn't operate like that.''
witnesses to the shootings said men in civilian clothes, believed to be members of the special air services anti-terrorist force, jumped from a car and opened fire on two men and a women walking down the avenue leading to the border between gibraltar and spain
two cars connected with the dead ira members were found in gibraltar. sir geoffrey howe, the british foreign secretary, said monday a third car was believed to be involved
he said it was not true, as earlier official reports had said, that a car the ira members parked near the governor's residence sunday was packed with explosives
howe said a ``dreadful terrorist act'' was averted when the commandos killed the ira members
agustin valladolid, spokesman for spanish state security in madrid, said the white ford was found in the sun parking lot in marbella at about 6:30 p.m. tuesday
he said it was left in the lot sunday, but there had been no danger of an explosion. valladolid said police had stepped up their search for a fourth member of the ira team
the ira identified the three people killed as mairead farrell, 31; daniel mccann, 30, and sean savage, 24. although unarmed, they were ``on active service,'' it said
backers of a constitutional amendment to make english the state's official language gathered about 260,000 new signatures tuesday, easily topping the number required to get on the november ballot, a spokeswoman said
we are feeling very good,'' said patricia fulton, spokeswoman for the florida english campaign
taking advantage of primary election day, volunteers stationed near polling places throughout the state collected about 60,000 signatures of registered voters, and workers from a california company collected nearly 200,000, ms. fulton said
the new signatures, added to the 236,000 already in hand, should put the movement at well beyond the 342,939 needed for a referendum. about 125,500 of the signatures already have been verified
the signatures were obtained despite the efforts of the league of united latin american citizens, which took out advertisements in hispanic newspapers around the state warning voters about the proposed amendment and urging them to register so that they could vote against it in the general election
we're accused of being racist or xenophobics, because people think we are anti-immigrants,'' said dr. mark laporta, chairman on the florida english campaign
nothing could be farther from the truth. my father was an immigrant,'' laporta said. he insisted the measure was designed to spur immigrants to learn the language and the ways of the united states
lulac and other hispanic groups oppose the florida and u.s. english campaigns because they believed they have racist elements
if enough signatures are verified, the proposed referendum would be submitted to the state supreme court for review of its wording
the referendum would ask voters to designate english as the official language, but would leave it up the state legislature to decide what, if any, government practices would be changed
proponent of the referendum, for example, would like to see the government increase funds for english-language education
a south african diplomat cited for simple assault after his car struck a protester and a police officer said tuesday that he was sorry about the incident
south african vice consul duke kent brown said during an interview with radio station wjoy-wqcr that he did not expect the group of anti-apartheid protesters to block his exit from a parking lot near the radio station monday
it's unfortunate that whole situation arose,'' he said
brown was charged with simple assault, released on his own recognizance and ordered to appear in court in april in connection with the incident
the state department said brown had consular, rather than diplomatic, immunity, meaning he was not automatically exempt from prosecution. but he can claim immunity in court as an ``affirmative defense'' on the grounds that the alleged acts were performed in the exercise of his consular function
about 30 members of the vermont committee on southern africa had gathered outside the station to protest brown's participation in a morning talk show, according to wjoy-wqcr news director jim condon
brown said he had expected the protest to continue, but that ``i would ignore them as i would leave.''
some of the protesters were on the hood of the car when it accelerated, condon said
brown said he did not see the police officer, todd shepard, who suffered bruises on his leg. ``i was very surprised to hear that a policeman had been injured and i did apologize to him when i saw him,'' brown said
brown said he was glad to hear that protester laurie larson of richmond was not badly injured. larson suffered minor bruises
a man who claims israeli agents threw his bride off a cruise ship to her death during their honeymoon in retaliation for a book he wrote critical of israel was charged tuesday with murder
scott robin roston, first told authorities his wife, karen waltz roston, was blown overboard by a gust of wind while jogging on feb. 13, and changed his story when authorities noted it wasn't windy that night
roston was indicted by a federal grand jury on a count of second-degree murder under a statute covering killings aboard ships. if convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison
the bahamian government has sought to extradite roston, 36, because the death took place when the couple were on the cruise ship stardancer, which is registered in that country
under terms of its treaty with the united states, the bahamas cannot extradite roston if he is convicted or acquitted in this country, assistant u.s. attorney patricia collins said. he could still faces charges there, however, if the u.s. trial ends in a mistrial or hung jury, she said
defense attorney paul e. potter said he will seek bail during a hearing on friday. roston has been held without bail since his arrest feb. 15
roston, who lives in santa monica, is the author of ``nightmare in israel,'' published in 1987 by vantage press, a subsidy publisher whose authors usually help pay for the cost of their books
he feels that this murder is the result of a book he published last year in new york city in which he exposed the numerous human rights abuses which he perceived in israel,'' potter said after roston's arrest
potter said tuesday that the book is ``the key to the case.''
the body of mrs. roston, 26, was recovered by the coast guard and roston was arrested when the ship docked in los angeles. they had been married less than two weeks
potter said ``he feels that she was murdered by israeli secret agents.'' vote figures. no pickup.</note>
massachusetts gov. michael dukakis ran away with maryland's democratic presidential primary tuesday, while vice president george bush soundly defeated kansas sen. bob dole in the republican contest
democratic sen. paul sarbanes easily overcame two little-known primary opponents in his bid for a third term. he will face thomas blair, a millionaire newcomer to politics, who beat eight other candidates for the republican nomination
in the democratic presidential race, with 643 of 1,574 precincts or 41 percent reporting, dukakis had 65,527 votes or 45 percent to jesse jackson's 35,855 votes or 24 percent; tennessee sen. albert gore jr. had 15,506 votes or 11 percent; and missouri rep. richard gephardt had 12,024 votes or 8 percent
former colorado sen. gary hart finished with 5,713 votes or 4 percent; and illinois sen. paul simon tallied 4,740 votes or 3 percent
in the republican primary, bush gathered 25,870 votes or 54 percent to dole's 14,643 votes or 31 percent, with 426 of 1,574 precincts or 27 percent reporting
new york rep. jack kemp and former tv evangelist pat robertson was next with 3,260 votes or 7 percent, followed by new york rep. jack kemp with 2,861 votes or 6 percent
bush won despite a late effort by dole that included a day of campaigning by the kansas senator in what his staff considered one of his better super tuesday states
at stake were 41 gop delegates and 67 democratic delegates
sarbanes' opponents in the democratic primary were a. robert kaufman, 56, a socialist who wants to use the campaign as a platform to express his concerns about the economy and social ills in the united states, and b. emerson sweatt, 44, who says he has masterminded federal drug control efforts since 1970, is owed $6 million by the federal government and claims to be the only man on earth with a ``valid legal right to subpoena the entire congress to testify in a civil suit against the government.''
blair, a montgomery county millionaire who had never run for office, was the pre-primary favorite
maryland got scant attention from the presidential contenders despite the switch to super tuesday from the traditional may primary, which democratic leaders hoped would help the state play a bigger role in the nominating process. reaction, comments from coleridge, other detail. no pickup</note>
the abu nidal palestinian terrorist group freed a british relief agency official and his syrian aide tuesday, five days after seizing them in this southern port city
peter coleridge, 44, middle east coordinator of the british relief agency oxfam, and omar traboulsi, 31, appeared physically fit when members of abu nidal's fatah-revolutionary council drove them to the sidon apartment of mustafa saad, a sunni moslem leader
we thank you for your hospitality,'' coleridge said in arabic when they reached the apartment on the second floor
abu nidal's guerrillas seized them thursday while coleridge was taking pictures of the ein el-hilweh palestinian refugee camp
coleridge told reporters tuesday: ``i am a guest in lebanon. i should have realized that shooting pictures at ein el-hilweh is a big mistake
i made a mistake by not asking for a permission from the authority in ein el-hilweh. i know and respect the people who took us. there has been no kidnapping ... they were only applying security procedures.''
we were well treated,'' he added
traboulsi sat next to coleridge and did not speak. coleridge said he ``will leave lebanon,'' but would not disclose his travel plans
coleridge told bbc radio's ``pm'' program he and traboulsi had been interrogated, blindfolded, handcuffed and put into the trunks of two cars
on tuesday, mustafa saad identified the men involved as being from abu nidal
coleridge said they were driven to an isolated place about half an hour from sidon and held there for the rest of their captivity
oxfam gave news of coleridge's release to his wife, angela, at their home in headington, england. the couple have three children _ jessie, 12, sara, 11, and edward, 5
mrs coleridge said she and the children were ``overwhelmed and absolutely delighted.'' she added, ``all i feel like doing now is sitting down and having a nice, quiet cup of tea.''
coleridge said he heard no news of any other hostages, including anglican envoy terry waite, during his captivity. waite disappeared in beirut in january 1987. no one has claimed responsibility
the release leaves leaves 22 foreigners still missing in lebanon, including nine americans. held longest is terry a. anderson, chief middle east correspondent of the associated press, who was kidnapped march 16, 1985
coleridge and traboulsi had gone to sidon last week to inspect relief groups supported by oxfam. it was the british official's first visit to lebanon in three years
coleridge said his camera and opel station wagon were returned, but a security source said the palestinians ``confiscated the film coleridge was shooting.''
abu nidal, whose real name is sabry al-banna, broke with yasser arafat's palestine liberation organization in the early 1970s and founded the fatah-revolutionary council
his followers have been blamed for scores of terrorist acts, including the december 1985 assaults at the rome and vienna airports in which 20 people died
coleridge and traboulsi were accompanied to saad's apartment by fatah-revolutionary council spokesman walid khaled
he said the men ``were held for questioning as a precautionary measure after shooting pictures in military zones.''
joe redington stole the lead of the 1,150-mile iditarod trail sled dog race on tuesday as he and herbie nayokpuk sailed past other mushers who had packed down a smooth, fast trail for them
redington, a wasilla resident who is a founder of the 16-year-old race, and nayokpuk, of shishmaref, took their mandatory 24-hour layovers on sunday. the race leaders passed them by, only to get bogged down in freshly fallen snow as they crossed the alaska range
the leading mushers then took their mandatory layovers at rohn, 271 miles from the race's start in anchorage. they watched helplessly as redington and nayokpuk _ and less than two hours later, joe garnie of teller _ powered past them
i kind of have this feeling in the back of my mind that we're going to see two eskimos _ garnie and nayokpuk _ blazing across this state,'' said jerry austin, one of the mushers taking a layover at rohn
joe runyan of nenana was the first musher to leave rohn, at 10:30 p.m. monday. but he has not declared his 24-hour layover, and so is behind redington, who left rohn at 7:20 a.m. tuesday. nayokpuk left rohn two minutes behind redington. garnie left at 9 a.m
still at rohn, in the order in which they arrived, were: jan masek of anchorage; lavon barve of wasilla; defending champion susan butcher of manley; jacques philip of thomery, france; austin, of st. michael; tim moerlein of kasilof; and, in 11th place, two-time iditarod champion rick swenson
from rohn, the teams descend from the heights of the alaska range into the timbered interior of the state for the longest stretch between checkpoints in the race. mushers must contend with a bleak and treacherous area known as farewell burn before reaching the next checkpoint, 93 miles away at nikolai

tennessee sen. albert gore jr. edged jesse jackson to win north carolina's democratic presidential primary tuesday, while vice president george bush held off a late surge by kansas sen. bob dole in the republican race
with 2,270 of 2,387 precincts or 95 percent reporting, gore had 224,514 votes or 35 percent; jackson had 212,833 votes or 33 percent; massachusetts gov. michael dukakis had 130,870 votes or 20 percent; missouri rep. richard gephardt had 37,978 votes or 6 percent; and former colorado sen. gary hart had 15,842 votes or 2 percent
in the republican race, with 2,279 precincts or 95 percent reporting: bush had 117,846 votes or 45 percent; dole had 104,093 votes or 40 percent; pat robertson had 25,356 votes or 10 percent; and new york rep. jack kemp had 10,931 votes or 4 percent
eighty-two democratic delegates and 54 gop delegates were up for grabs in the third-largest of 14 southern and border states holding primaries

massachusetts gov. michael dukakis and vice president george bush parlayed their neighborly ties into overwhelming victories in rhode island's presidential primaries on tuesday
in the democratic race, with 226 of 320 precincts or 71 percent reporting, dukakis crushed all challengers with 23,842 votes or 72 percent
next came jesse jackson with 4,572 votes or 14 percent; missouri rep. richard gephardt with 1,389 votes or 4 percent; tennessee sen. albert gore jr. with 1,294 votes or 4 percent; illinois sen. paul simon with 837 votes or 2 percent; and former colorado sen. gary hart with 518 votes or 2 percent
in the republican contest, with 223 of 320 precincts or 70 percent reporting, bush tallied 6,449 votes or 65 percent; kansas sen. bob dole had 2,222 votes or 22 percent; pat robertson finished with 590 votes or 6 percent; and new york rep. jack kemp was last with 476 votes or 5 percent
at issue were 22 democratic and 21 republican delegates
dukakis, the governor of a neighboring state, and bush, a new england native, had both worked the state long before their presidential campaigns officially began, and each picked up endorsements from his party's top local political figures
bush came to the state in 1986 to help two fellow republicans, gov. edward d. diprete and rep. claudine schneider, win re-election that year, and diprete and schneider repaid the favor with vocal support this year
gore got a burst of publicity and built a sizable organization as the result of a january visit to the state. jackson made headlines in november, when he took a scituate elementary school teacher with him on a trip to the persian gulf to deliver children's presents to u.s. servicemen there. victim</head> reference to marcel kinsbourne to `he' sted `she.'</note>
rod matthews killed, his attorney says, because a prescription drug he took for school stoked the fires of madness in his adolescent mind
in an ironic twist, matthews' victim, 14-year-old shaun ouillette, also took the drug, ritalin, for years, using it, his mother says, to cool the frantic behavior that plagued his childhood
it calmed him down enough so we could help him,'' said jeanne quinn, the victim's mother. ``i was so proud that he could learn to manage his life.''
matthews, 15, is being tried as an adult on murder charges in the nov. 20, 1986, slaying of ouillette. he has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity
the defense has not disputed testimony that matthews planned the killing for a month, lured his victim to a secluded woods, then stalked him from behind, hitting him repeatedly with a baseball bat
his friends have testified he told them of his plans, then showed them the body on two separate occasions. one quoted matthews as saying he killed ouillette because ``he wanted to know what it was like to kill somebody.''
police testified how matthews calmly lied to them about ouillette for the three weeks the boy's body lay in the snowy woods
the case is expected to go to the jury wednesday
in testimony last week, matthews' mother, janice, said her son's behavior had become a problem in the third grade and that he was placed on ritalin after a brief visit to his pediatrican
she cried as she told of the doctor's decision to prescribe the drug, a stimulant long used to calm hyperactive children and those with attention problems
the boy's doctor, theodore goodman, testified that he relied only on what mrs. matthews told him. there was no testing and no follow-up on the drug's effects
on monday, psychiatrist bernard yudowitz testified that if a child with mental illness is misdiagnosed and given ritalin, ``impulsivity and abnormal behavior increase and their ability to act appropriately in a given setting decreases.''
in my experience if the child has an underlying mental problem, ritalin may not help and it may hurt,'' he said
last week, norman bernstein, a harvard-based child psychologist, said matthews ``had within him a world of angry, fearful destructive thoughts.''
matthews attorney, john philip white, said ritalin contributed to the boy's homicidal intent
in this case is the insidious element of mental illness with the overlying thread of ritalin,'' white told the jury
but on tuesday, marcel kinsbourne, chief of behavioral neurology at the eunice shriver center in waltham, said the drug could not be considered a factor in the killing
norfolk county assistant district attorney peter casey asked kinsbourne if the drug would have an ``enhancing effect'' on matthews' planning, execution and coverup of the slaying
absolutely none whatever,'' he said
mrs. quinn, who listened from her front row seat, agreed
i don't believe it killed my son,'' she said. ``i suppose if i were his parent, i would be looking for any way to explain what happened, but ritalin doesn't answer it for me.''
mrs. quinn said her son took ritalin from age 7 through 11 to help calm his hyperactivity. the boy also received therapy, she said
in the end, she said, it worked. the boy was weaned from the drug and shaun even told his mother he wanted to become a youth counselor
a lot of the kids he saw in group therapy were messed up kids,'' she said. ``he wanted to help and now it's all gone. what a waste.''
gunmen in a car shot at a police station tuesday, killing one officer, and to cover their escape threw a grenade into a courtyard where children were playing, authorities reported
they said two suspects were arrested shortly after the attack, but the prisoners were not identified
no group asserted responsibility for the attack. it came less than a day after guerrillas of the corsican national liberation front vowed to intensify actions to win independence from france for the island in the mediterranean 125 miles off the french mainland
security minister robert pandraud, speaking at lunel in southern france, condemned the killing and said: ``we will fight against the murderers without pity.''
police said three or four people in a car fired pistols at the police station, fatally wounding an officer who was hit twice in the stomach
as they fled, the killers threw a hand grenade into a courtyard where several policemen's children were playing, and one of the children was treated for shock, according to authorities
police said the car used in the attack was found abandoned in a ditch near the police station
one of four masked members of the national liberation front, speaking to reporters monday near the town of bastiaa, said: ``there is no question of establishing a truce. we are going to pursue and even intensify our actions.'' the group has claimed responsibility for several assassinations, including the sept. 13, 1983, shooting of a top government official for northern corsica. updates results; picks up 4th graf, `the republicans ...'</note>
jesse jackson nudged tennessee sen. albert gore to win georgia's democratic presidential primary tuesday, while vice president george bush swamped his republican rivals
with 2,002 of 2,571 precincts or 78 percent reporting, jackson had 174,003 votes or 39 percent; gore had 149,180 votes or 34 percent; massachusetts gov. michael dukakis had 62,987 votes or 14 percent; missouri rep. richard gephardt had 31,828 votes or 7 percent; and former colorado sen. gary hart had 13,116 votes or 3 percent
in the republican race, with 1,922 precincts or 75 percent reporting, bush had 135,769 votes or 54 percent; kansas sen. bob dole had 57,628 votes or 23 percent; pat robertson had 43,668 votes or 17 percent; and new york rep. jack kemp had 13,213 votes or 5 percent
the republicans had 48 delegates up for grabs, with the democrats offering 77 delegates to their convention in atlanta in july
one of the state's best-known democrats, former president jimmy carter, withheld his endorsement. but another, sen. sam nunn, disclosed that he cast an absentee ballot for gore because his ``views come closest to my own views as to the steps our nation must take to meet our challenges at home and abroad.''
gop officials conceded bush's association with reagan and his organization gave him the edge, but robertson displayed organizational strength in some precinct meetings last month
jackson pulled off a surprise in 1984, winning southeastern georgia's 1st congressional district, which includes savannah. jackson's strong showing then was credited to a low democratic turnout combined with success in getting his supporters to the polls
dukakis made several other visits to the state, including stops in atlanta on the day he announced his candidacy and the day after his victory in the new hampshire primary
on sunday, dukakis stopped in for a half-hour visit with the former president, who has met with all the other candidates at various times
i think there's a great deal of compatibility between my basic attitude towards government and that of governor dukakis,'' carter said afterwards
to encourage participation in the primary, state officials included a referendum on broadening the eligibility for exemptions for the elderly from some property and school taxes
jesse jackson elbowed past tennessee sen. albert gore jr. to grab tuesday's presidential primary in mississippi, while vice president george bush left the rest of the republican field in the dust
democrats also waged a spirited primary battle for the senate seat john stennis is leaving after 41 years
in the democratic race, with 1,750 of 2,340 precincts or 75 percent reporting: jackson had 118,652 votes or 44 percent; gore had 91,337 votes or 34 percent; massachusetts gov. michael dukakis had 22,661 votes or 8 percent; and missouri rep. richard gephardt had 14,996 votes or 6 percent. former colorado sen. gary hart had 9,900 votes or 4 percent
in the republican race, with 1,801 of 2,340 precincts or 77 percent reporting, bush had won with 78,424 votes or 67 percent; dole had 19,547 votes or 17 percent; former tv evangelist pat robertson had 15,115 votes or 13 percent; and new york rep. jack kemp had 4,289 votes or 4 percent
forty democratic delegates were at stake and 31 gop delegates
in the senate primary, rep. wayne dowdy battled secretary of state dick molpus for the chance to run against republican rep. trent lott in november for stennis' seat. with 1,456 of 2,340 precincts or 62 percent reporting, dowdy had 125,471 or 55 percent to molpus' 94,349 or 41 percent
gilbert founation, a biloxi pipefitter, had 8,012 or 4 percent
stennis, 86, announced last october that he would retire, making this only the second time in 41 years that the state has had an open u.s. senate race
dowdy, 44, who gained his congressional seat in a 1981 special election, stressed his experience in washington. molpus, 38, touted his record as director of federal-state programs under former gov. william winter and his work as secretary of state since 1984
in recent weeks, molpus made dowdy's attendance record _ ranked one of the five worst in the house according to molpus _ a campaign issue. dowdy has countered that his voting mark is almost the same as that of stennis'
the new democratic party government in manitoba, the only socialist administration in canada's 10 provinces, was defeated tuesday in a confidence vote
premier howard pawley's government had been clinging to power with a one-seat majority in the provincial legislature
but jim walding, a new democrat legislator, voted with the opposition conservative and liberal parties on a crucial budget measure and the result was considered a vote of no confidence
the vote was 28-27 against the government
opposition members pounded their desks victoriously after the vote
obviously we are in a very difficult situation,'' pawley said, and he indicated his party will meet wednesday to decide whether to call an early election
it is traditional in canada for a government defeated on a major measure considered to be a confidence vote to go to the polls
the crisis in manitoba has national ramifications since pawley is the most active provincial opponent of the free-trade agreement federal prime minister brian mulroney's conservative government negotiated last year with the united states, but which has yet to be ratified
pawley also opposes a constitutional accord mulroney secured with the province of quebec, recognizing the predominantly french-speaking province as a ``distinct society.''
vice president george bush jubilantly proclaimed himself the man to beat in the republican presidential sweepstakes, saying his super tuesday performance ``exceeded my fondest expectations.''
standing alongside his wife, barbara, in a packed hotel ballroom in his adopted home town, bush said, ``as i said ... whoever wins super tuesday convincingly is going to be the next president, and i'll repeat it: i'm going to be the next president of the united states.''
this exceeded my fondest expectations,'' the vice president said
you've given me and barbara a big lift,'' bush told supporters. he and his wife had begun the day by casting their ballots in the texas gop primary. bush then went into seclusion in the afternoon
bush basked in the glow of his election triumphs only briefly, giving a talk to supporters and greeting well-wishers in the ballroom, which was decorated with bush banners, the american flag and red, white and blue balloons. his aides had said earlier bush would not accede to sen. bob dole's demand that the vice president appear in one-on-one, lincoln-douglas-style debates in illinois
the vice president had awaited returns in a 21st floor penthouse suite in the westin oaks hotel, just a few blocks from the hotel houstonian, where he maintains a permanent residence. in washington, he lives in the official vice president's house
bush brought to houston two governors _ new hampshire's john sununu and south carolina's carroll campbell _ who had played pivotal roles in his earlier victories in their states
bush called his conquest of dole and rivals jack kemp and pat robertson ``a big, a major political victory. this is a national victiory.''
the vice president said he felt his performance tuesday was a reflection not of his campaign style but of his message ``to reduce the deficit without raising taxes, to make progress toward peace through strength, and making the united states strong ...''
reducing the threat of war is not a republican issue and not a democratic issue,'' he said. ``it's a national issue.''
bush had no public activities scheduled for wednesday and his campaign aides planned to hold strategy sessins here
the vice president planned to fly to chicago on thursday for the start of five days of intensive campaigning in the illinois primary
tennessee sen. albert gore jr. emerged king of the democratic hill in tuesday's presidential primary in arkansas, while vice president george bush brushed aside republican rivals
with 1,311 of 2,762 precincts or 47 percent reporting, gore had 79,145 votes or 37 percent; massachusetts gov. michael dukakis had 40,285 votes or 19 percent; jesse jackson had 37,772 votes or 17 percent; and missouri rep. richard gephardt had 26,538 votes or 12 percent
in the gop race, with 706 of 2,762 precincts or 26 percent reporting, bush had 14,527 votes or 48 percent; kansas sen. bob dole had 7,913 votes or 26 percent; and former tv evangelist pat robertson had 5,450 votes or 18 percent. new york rep. jack kemp had 1,387 votes or 5 percent
in the 1st congressional district, veteran democratic rep. bill alexander defeated political consultant darrell glascock, who went to court to get on the ballot. alexander had 41,552 votes, or 67 percent, to glascock's 20,034, or 33 percent. no republican sought the office
thirty-eight of arkansas' 44 democratic delegates and all 27 gop delegates were up for grabs
turnout was expected to be low with the top state offices not on the ballot because of a constitutional amendment that increased terms from two years to four years beginning with the 1986 elections. news digest: undated _ pm-super tuesday rdp, a0446; washington _ pm-super tuesday-analysis, a0443; san antonio, texas _ pm-jackson-south, a0442; undated _ pm-state primaries rdp, a0465; damascus, syria _ pm-syria-us, a0469; panama city, panama _ pm-panama, a0492; phoenix, ariz. _ pm-mecham impeachment, a0505; washington _ pm-arresting senators, a0499; chicago _ pm-soup kitchen smiles, a0448

prime minister yitzhak shamir said the bus hijacking in which three plo guerrillas and three israeli hostages were killed was initiated by the same element that is behind three months of anti-occupation rioting
these are the same people who incite violence in the territories,'' shamir said on israel radio after monday's attack in southern israel. ``we shall not tire fighting them.''
analysts said the attack, for which the palestine liberation organization claimed responsibility, was aimed at sabotaging the united states' middle east peace plan and will strengthen the stance of israeli hardliners
aids experts have sharply criticized a book by the sex experts dr. william masters and virginia johnson that claims to find wide spread of aids among heterosexuals
they have not done even the most rudimentary things to establish any representativeness of their results,'' says dr. june osborn, a virologist, pediatrician and dean of the school of public health at the university of michigan
in the book, released monday and titled ``crisis: heterosexual behavior in the age of aids,'' masters and johnson reported finding a 5 percent aids infection rate in men who said they had at least six sexual partners a year for five years, and a 7 percent infection rate in similarly active women
a u.s. supreme court ruling about when companies must disclose merger discussions could lead to fewer mergers and hinder corporate competitiveness, some legal experts say
in monday's ruling, the court affirmed for the first time a key legal theory strengthening shareholder ability to sue a company for fraud. approval of the so-called fraud-on-the-market theory could spawn a wave of new lawsuits by disgruntled shareholders, lawyers said
the ruling stemmed from a case that attracted enormous attention because it raised questions about a company's legal responsibilities regarding disclosure of information that could affect its stock price, including preliminary merger negotiations with another company
a 12-state study found that advanced math and science courses and family income were more important factors than ethnicity in how hispanic high school students scored on college entrance tests
the study of 1,928 hispanic and non-hispanic white students, presented monday to the national association of secondary school principals, also found that scores of both groups increased with the size of schools they attended
george a. chambers, professor of educational administration at the university of iowa, and researcher phyllis s. peterson studied 1987 scores on the american college test, the predominant college admission test in 28 states
roman catholic youths rioted in northern ireland after the british government announced its soldiers had killed three unarmed ira guerrillas it said were preparing a terrorist attack in gibraltar
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said monday that a ``dreadful terrorist act has been averted'' by the slayings in the fortress colony on spain's southern coast. ``the three people killed were actively involved in the planning and attempted excecution of that act,'' he told the house of commons
police in gibraltar said they believed the three were involved in an irish republican army plan to detonate a car bomb at the governor's residence during today's ceremonial changing of the guard, which hundreds of spectators attend
an attorney for five relatives of challenger astronauts says that other families who settled with the government and with rocket maker morton thiokol for $7.7 million were shortchanged
that settlement is woefully inadequate,'' said ronald d. krist, a houston attorney who represented astronauts' survivors from the apollo spacecraft fire in 1967 as well as three families from the 1986 space shuttle disaster
krist said the four challenger families in the government-company settlement should have and ``would have netted more money'' if they had hired lawyers. news digest: undated _ sup--elections rdp; undated _ sup--democrats; undated _ sup--republicans; chicago _ sup--on to illinois; undated sup--state primaries rdp; panama city, panama _ panama; washington _ challenger settlement; dedham, mass. _ ritalin irony.</note>
arabs stabbed a man accused of aiding israel and dumped the corpse at his mother's door, and israeli gunfire killed another palestinian on tuesday, hospitals and witnesses reported
hundreds of arab women held street protests in the occupied territories on a ``women's day'' called by the palestine liberation organization
hospital officials in nablus said three arab protesters were wounded by israeli gunfire, but the army said a jewish settler shot one of them after the settler's car was stoned in the balata refugee camp
the abu nidal palestinian terrorist group freed a british relief agency official and his syrian aide tuesday, five days after seizing them in this southern port city, a sunni moslem leader reported
peter coleridge, 44, middle east coordinator of the british relief agency oxfam, and omar traboulsi, 31, appeared fit when members of abu nidal's fatah-revolutionary council drove them to the sidon apartment of mustafa saad, the sunni leader
we thank you for your hospitality,'' coleridge said in arabic when they reached the apartment on the second floor
commuter airlines that carried nearly 30 million people last year are being targeted for stepped-up inspections by the federal aviation administration after seven fatal accidents and 56 deaths since november
the agency announced the special inspections of the commuters, which normally fly aircraft of 30 or fewer seats, at a news conference tuesday. it said that about 20 percent of the 173 commuter carriers are expected to be singled out for particuarly close scrutiny
none of the airlines was identified and faa officials could not say immediately how the airlines would be selected to special attention
the world health organization's chief aids investigator called sex experts william masters and virginia johnson irresponsible for suggesting aids can be transmitted by casual social contact
dr. jonathan mann, the american director of who's global program on aids, challenged the noted sex researchers to produce scientific evidence or admit they were indulging in ``idle speculation.''
if it's just theorizing, then i think they have done us all a grave disservice,'' mann told reporters tuesday at the first international conference on the global impact of aids
a justice department official said tuesday he favors raising congressional pay to as much as $175,000 in exchange for ending a ``double standard'' exempting senators and representatives from federal ethics laws
assistant attorney general william weld said it is ``neither logical nor ... consonant with the notion of fair play'' to make it a crime for executive branch officials to accept fees or honoraria for job-related activities, while allowing members of congress to do so
in a national press club speech attacking public corruption, weld said he favors ``raising the salary of all members of congress to a level around somewhere between $150,000 and $175,000 a year. this would enable you to do some other things like prohibit honoraria.''
a prosecutor accused one of gov. evan mecham's lawyers tuesday of using innuendo to delve into the sex life of arizona's top lawman, a subject ruled off-limits at mecham's impeachment trial
attorney fred craft was trying to undermine the crediblity of department of public safety director ralph milstead as the key witness against mecham on an obstruction of justice charge
the 63-year-old governor, who has not attended any sessions of the impeachment trial since it began last week, is accused of ordering milstead not to help the attorney general investigate an alleged death threat to a grand jury witness by a mecham aide
bill britt, who repeatedly refused offers of food and a warm home, died two weeks before his children discovered his body, partially devoured by animals in the woods he called home since 1969
autopsy results tuesday showed that britt, 52, died of hypothermia and was dead two weeks before he was discovered monday by two of his three children in his makeshift wigwam in brookline, according to the suffolk county medical examiner's report
britt died in the woods near the chestnut hill reservoir, near the affluent community of the same name where he was born and grew up. he had lived in the woods since 1969, but did not attract much attention until 1985, when officials tried to move him into public or subsidized housing. britt's resistance to being moved brought him national attention; last may he appeared on ``late night with david letterman'' and at one point actor mickey rooney planned to buy the rights to his story

thought for today: ``no man has a right in america to treat any other man tolerantly, for tolerance is the assumption of superiority.'' _ wendell willkie, american politician (1892-1944)
the week before mikhail gorbachev arrived in the united states for the december arms summit, president reagan granted a rare interview to the four major networks' anchors
that's right, four: peter jennings of abc, dan rather of cbs, tom brokaw of nbc, and bernard shaw, washington anchor for cnn
although he had already interviewed reagan in october, shaw agreed that the prime-time news special in which he questioned reagan along with the three other anchors was a high-profile symbol of cnn's hard-earned respectability
that conversation the week before the summit was a turning point, i suppose you would have to say,'' said shaw in an interview at his anchor desk at the cnn bureau. ``i went back and asked (white house chief of staff) howard baker about that, and he said, `we regard you as the fourth network, and that's why we included you in the interview.'''
the reagan interview turned a lot of unsought attention on the low-key shaw, a former correspondent for abc, cbs and westinghouse broadcasting, who recalls idolizing edward r. murrow as a child in chicago and at 13 declaring, ``i want to be a cbs news correspondent.''
after stints with westinghouse and cbs, then covering latin america for abc, shaw joined cnn in 1980. he wanted to be an anchor, and ``there was no room at the inn at abc, a lot of other talented people standing in line.'' plus, he was encouraged to join the then-fledgling 24-hour news network by friends daniel schorr and george watson, the washington bureau chief
the next year, john hinckley shot president reagan outside a washington hotel where reagan had just delivered a speech
shaw had finished his news update summarizing the speech and switched back to cnn headquarters in atlanta when a staffer told him someone had fired shots at the president's motorcade
i screamed to the control room to tell atlanta to come back to us right away,'' shaw said. shaw filled viewers in with the sketchy information he had, then switched back to atlanta, but reese schoenfield, then president of cnn, ordered atlanta to go back to washington and stay there
and they did, and there we were,'' said shaw. he was on the air for 10 hours
i was pretty conscious that day of my demeanor, tone of voice and facial expressions,'' he said, ``because that camera magnifies everything, and i was determined to be as low-key as possible, as factual as possible and as dispassionate as possible. a story like that requires no heat.''
low-key is the operative word in describing shaw's style. he considers the celebrity aspects of his job ``corruptive'' and prefers to spend his free time with his wife, linda, and their two children. besides ``doing better'' in his job at cnn, shaw, 47, says his only ambition is to write books, fiction and non-fiction
he's a perfectionist who constantly worries about improving his performance and the network's. he said that when he left the air after the iowa and new hampshire primaries, he lay awake for hours ``replaying in my head what we did _ what we did right, what we did wrong, what i could have done better.''
he does his homework every time and worries over it like it's his first time, and calls afterwards to be critiqued on it,'' said cnn executive vice president ed turner. ``i don't know anybody as good as he is, in my 30 years in the business, at his specialty, which was a job once done brilliantly by (walter) cronkite, before him by (robert) trout, people who can sit with a breaking story for hours on end and never lose the various threads that you have to keep hold of.''
if it's grueling to be on the air for hours on end, it's also fulfilling
while his colleagues at the other networks struggle to get even an hour or two of prime-time coverage for the primaries, shaw, who anchors cnn's political coverage, gets the whole night
there was a magical moment, or hour, between 9 and 10 o'clock in manchester (n.h.),'' he recalled, ``and it seemed like every candidate was coming down to the ballroom to make statements. and it just looked like a visual ballet, where we went from kemp to gephardt to bush to dole, or what have you. and i looked up on the monitors, and we were the only ones on the air. and i felt good.''

super tuesday might have resolved a few political questions, but it has left the same old economic problems to be dealt with _ or dodged
biggest of these is the persistence of federal budget deficits in defiance of the candidates, who one and all declare it unconscionable that uncle sam should spend more than he receives
everyone knows what has to be done to balance the budget, but that's easy. the difficulty is in the accomplishment, and it is in that area, says the tax foundation, that the candidates have proved artful dodgers
declaring its astonishment at the wishful thinking that serves candidates in lieu of realistic tax and spending proposals, the foundation's ``shadow committee on the federal budget'' expresses despair
it suggests that the wishful, ``escapist'' thinking being expressed by the candidates might be setting the stage for even more deficits to come, perhaps even into the 21st century
to avoid the deficit issue, the group says, is to avoid not just the issue of the budget itself but of many challenges included in it, such as defense, space exploration, education, research, the role of government and dozens more
avoid the issue of the budget, and you avoid the issues that one would expect to be discussed in a presidential election year
what especially irritates the committee is that candidates have been churning out optimistic deficit projections that even a slight underperformance by the economy might subvert. in other words, committing the same old crime
with the structural deficit hovering around the $150 billion mark, it will not take much of a shortfall in economic performance to push the deficit to new record levels,'' it says
it is such evasion that created the deficits in the first place, and it was the continuation of such thinking, more so than poor economic performance, that perpetuated them
by avoiding the issues, americans became accustomed to the notion that, somehow, it was possible to have their cake and eat it, too. or, as president lyndon johnson put it, the nation could simultaneously have guns and butter
the latest evasion of the deficit issue was given almost official approval with the creation of an economic commission to recommend taxes and spending cuts designed to reduce the deficit. but its report won't come out until fall
once again, the harsh reality was pushed off into the future, allowing the candidates to discourse on more optimistic possibilities. but, says the foundation, that's dreaming
to begin with, the committee's march report states, there is little room for further cuts in defense spending, paring of grants to states and localities and reductions in the operating budgets of federal agencies
it points out that mandated payments for individuals, together with interest charges, now comprise more than 60 percent of total outlays, and those payments and interest charges are likely to increase in years ahead
these huge payments are also for existing needs, but there is a future to consider, too. and the future, always an unknown, is likely to present more possibilities for spending, and therefore more financial challenges
in the past, and it appears in the present, too, those challenges have not been met. and now they are being evaded by the very folks who want you to believe that it is they who should lead the nation into the future
poland has many crushing problems: burgeoning foreign debt, political dissension, inadequate social services. but the one that rankles poles the most is the telephone system
there aren't enough telephones to go around, but people who do have them find that if the phones themselves work, the system doesn't
one man said he dialed his office in warsaw three times in succession and each time reached a different number
at a community newspaper, a reporter picked up the office's only phone and got a dial tone
you are looking at a miracle,'' he said, holding up the receiver. ``it works.''
a westerner living in warsaw said her phone stopped working when workmen started digging in her neighborhood; she was told she would have to wait a month to have service restored
but the main thing is trying to get a telephone in the first place
more than 2 million applications for telephones are pending in poland and the list is growing faster than phones are being made and installed. the average waiting period is 13 years, but some have been waiting 20 years or more
like other areas of our economy, the situation is not satisfactory at the moment,'' said roman gebka, director of the telecommunications service for the state telephone and telegraph company
the basic problems now are a lack of equipment, a lack of cables ... and a lack of work force.''
poland has just 2.6 million telephone subscribers in its population of 37.5 million _ about 7 subscribers for each 100 people. subtract phones in offices and other public places, and that comes to just 1.8 million private phone customers
altogether poland has 11 actual telephone sets for every 100 people; the united states has 79, sweden 85, and great britain and west germany 51 each
in the countryside the problem is particularly acute. for 14.8 million poles in rural areas there are just 285,000 telephone subscriptions. and about 7,000 villages have no phones at all
but even people lucky enough to get phones have problems _ broken connections, buzzing or rattling noises on the line, mysterious misdirection of phone calls
not having a telephones is a fact of life in ursynow, a sprawling planned community of apartment blocks on the outskirts of warsaw. for its 135,000 people, it has 4,000 private telephones and 102 pay phones that often don't work. the commmunity eagerly awaits a central switching station that will allow 10,000 more phones
many poles do their telephoning while on the job, using the company phones. they also can try one of the nation's 85,000 pay phones, some of which work
hotel operators, restaurateurs and even private householders are usually willing to let others use their phones, for free or sometimes for a small fee
the cost of the lack of phones for poland's economy is very high and the prospects for any improvement soon are dim, gebka said in an interview in his office at the state telephone company in warsaw. he cited a soviet study that said one ruble invested in telephones led to three rubles in increased income
gebka said the ideal would be 20 million telephones in poland by the year 2000, or one for each of each of the 16 million to 17 million families expected by then, and the remainder for government and business
but he added that short of a miracle poland would not come near that goal. using all its currently available resources, poland can manage to install only about 150,000 phones a year
polish industry is as it is,'' he said. ``it produces as much as we are able to in this country. everything that the industry produces is being installed. there are no reserves.''
to step up production of telephone equipment and cable, he said, poland must build new factories
factories take five or six years to build and putting in additional telephone exchange stations takes about three more years, so it will take nearly a decade before poland can begin to speed up installations, gebka said
he also blamed part of the equipment shortage on the u.s.-led trade embargo that bans high-technology sales to the east bloc. poland's international calling capabilities are particularly hampered by the embargo, he said
the warsaw telephone exchange, which can handle up to 20,000 subscribers, is a long two-story building, about the size of an average elementary school in the united states. if poland had equipment using western microprocessors, the whole operation could fit into a single room, said janusz cienecki, the engineer in charge of the center
besides lacking the most sophisticated equipment, he said, the state-run telephone system has difficulty attracting qualified technicians because the starting pay is just 26,000 zlotys ($69) a month
a government report in february said more than 60 percent of the urban telephone systems are outdated and need modernization
communications minister antoni rajkiewicz has set a goal of adding 12 million new telephones in poland by 2010, but says it all hinges on increasing production capabilities of telephone equipment
in the meantime, most poles just wait
what shim min-sop is doing now conceivably could have landed him in jail not so long ago. he's drawing cartoons that poke gentle fun at south korean political leaders
and people are getting a laugh out of them, without worrying that something could happen to them as well
shim's cartoons seem tame by most standards. politicians and political parties are parodied as rival baseball teams and the jibes are never too strong. nevertheless, shim says, it is a remarkable change
in the past it was a taboo to caricature the big political names in this country,'' he said
ridiculing the president or making jokes about him, for example, were seen as anti-state acts
shim and other cartoonists have been able to take advantage of recent political liberalization in south korea to start injecting a little laughter and ridicule into politics
the cartoonists contend that political caricature is healthy and korean politics can benefit from it
cartoons and caricatures will bring the political leaders closer to the people,'' shim maintained
political cartoons have proliferated in newspapers and magazines and command large, enthusiastic audiences eager for a regular flow of material ranging from traditional editorial cartoons to long stories. literacy is very high in south korea but people prize cartoons for their humor
newspaper cartoons so far are low-key and ironic. some recent ones showed caricatures of the main political parties chasing each other in an unending circle, to symbolize ineffectiveness. another showed top leaders as squabbling babies
a favorite of cartoonists is to have bemused koreans staring at politicians battling for power and asking what is happening to the country
it is refreshing to see the taboos broken about the myths surrounding the political bigwigs,'' said han kye-su, a political analyst who has followed the growth of political cartooning
many cartoonists say they have always seen their work as a way of calling for reform and liberalization
korean cartoonists have been struggling for political change for a long time,'' shim said
cartoons are a valuable teaching tool that can vividly explain the meaning of an issue as well as amuse readers, shim added
the political cartoonist can present the issues in a more amusing, but understandable manner to the public.''
the newly installed president roh tae-woo, who pledged freedom of speech and expression after years of authoritarian rule, personally encouraged cartoonists to take up political subjects by saying he did not mind being caricatured
shim and other cartoonists say their work is still very gentle and restrained for fear of angering authorities and losing what freedom they have. but they say they expect to make their humor more biting as time goes on and liberalization expands
cartoonists are also restrained by fear of offending a politician's supporters, shim said. korea's factional politics stress loyalty and supporters tend to resent any joke at their leader's expense, he said
the reaction can be terrible from the supporters,'' shim said. ``people should learn to accept both positive and negative.''
anti-government students and dissident groups, which have long used cartoons in their political literature, also are making greater use of caricatures, but usually not in a humorous way
the cartoons distributed at anti-government rallies and meetings are biting and bitter. government and mainline opposition politicians are depicted as vicious tyrants suppressing the people with tear gas and clubs. some are more subtle, depicting the divided opposition leaders as crying infants quarreling over a toy
they are not jokes,'' said one dissident. ``they show the people the reality of the government and why there is no democracy in south korea.''
anti-government cartoons are distributed in pamphlets on college campuses or posted on trees and sidewalks at anti-government rallies
the united states, represented by a fiendish-looking uncle sam or a swaggering and bullying american soldier, is a fixture in the underground cartoons. dissidents claim the country's successive authoritarian governments have survived because of u.s. backing
one recent cartoon showed a tough-looking statue of liberty with a boxing glove on her upraised hand
shim and other cartoonists reject their underground competition and the radical politics behind it. they say change must be moderate
it's too early to expose politicians to a more revealing fashion,'' shim said
thirty-two years ago, roger vadim made the little-known brigitte bardot an international star with a movie called ``and god created woman.'' in 1988, the french director hopes to do the same with rebeccca demornay
not that the california-born, european-educated actress is unknown. she made a sensational film debut as the hooker who helped tom cruise conduct his ``risky business.'' roles in ``testament,'' ``runaway train,'' ``the trip to bountiful'' and other films have also been well reviewed
and god created woman'' provides her best role yet. and if you want to stay on her good side, don't suggest a comparison to how bardot played the role of a teen-age girl who was fatally attracted to men
there's really no relation between the two pictures,'' she insists. ``they have the same title and the same director. but really the title was used to get the film (financed) and really has no relation to the story or the characters.''
it's more a variation on the same theme than a remake,'' said vadim. ``what happened to a young girl at st. tropez in the south of france in 1956 can't really happen today in santa fe, n.m.''
vadim, who masterminded the careers of bardot, catherine deneuve and jane fonda and married bardot and fonda, was limited in his choice of a star for ``and god created woman'' because the producers, vestron, didn't want to go with an unknown
comparing her role to bardot's, was ``like comparing apples and oranges,'' demornay said. she outlined her own version of the character she played: ``robin is very mischievous, also naive and therefore funny a lot of the time. what attracted me to her was her strong streak of independent feminism. it might be disguised in her antics, but she really is a woman's woman.''
about vadim: ``he is great to work with, very perceptive, very sensitive to me as a woman. and as an actress and the protagonist in this film. it seemed very easy for him to identify with a woman, which is not easy for male directors. he's very laid-back and created an aura of relaxation on the set.''
the first ``and god created woman'' raised a furor among censors; the title was changed in italy, because the authorities ``didn't want god associated with such a film,'' vadim recalled
he still wonders what all the fuss was about: ``there was no nudity; bardot was naked only once and was covered by a sheet. i think the censors were infuriated because she played a woman who had no guilt about her sexuality.''
the 1988 version goes further with nudity and sex, though vadim insists he strove for a romantic feeling to the bedroom scenes. and eroticism presents no problem for demornay
i've done two women so far whose sexuality was part of the character,'' she said. ``robin in `and god created woman' was one of them (the other: `risky business'). it's delightful to me, if i can trust the sensibilities of the director, which i did, and if the scenes further the plot and illustrate facets of the character.''
are such scenes nervous-making on the set?
not to me,'' she said. ``it's as natural as anything else. i don't see this wall: `i'll do anything as an actress, but i won't express sexuality.' why not?''
the blond beauty was born in santa rosa, calif., 25 years ago but spent her childhood abroad. her parents divorced and her father is tv personality wally george
my stepfather died, and this made my mother restless,'' she said. ``she started to travel with both me and my brother. she was a very free-spirited, bohemian-type woman who thought a good education could be had by traveling and learning about new countries and cultures
so i lived in england for five years, in the austrian alps for seven years and in a lot of other countries in between for smaller amounts of time.''
returning to california in 1981, the actress enrolled at the lee strasberg theater institute, found an agent and won the ``risky business'' role over 800 applicants
surprisingly, the film didn't get her typed: ``i was lucky. most people seemed to view me as an actress playing the part of a call girl. i wasn't offered a lot of prostitute roles. i was able to play a young mother in `testament' with jane alexander. then `the trip to bountiful' with geraldine page. then a scruffy, tomboyish train mechanic in `runaway train.' so i've had good opportunities.''
what's next? she's brushing up on her shakespeare
a flutist with rubber lips, metal fingertips and not much else by way of physique is the latest graduate of the mcandroids laboratory in south london
being a robot and brand-new, it doesn't have a name yet, but its first public recitals will be given in september, when it goes on display at taiwan's new national museum of natural science
the flutist was born in the same cluttered workshop as tin twin, the guest keyboard player who thrilled teen-age fans of the thompson twins, a british pop group, on its 1986 world tour
like tin twin, the flutist is a robotized ``musician'' developed by mcandroids ltd., a special effects and 3-d animation team composed of two sculptors, a mechanical engineer and a computer artist
mcandroids' art and technology creations have been on display since 1984 in museums, traveling exhibitions and on tv shows across western europe
the flutist is going to t'aichung in taiwan along with a collection of musical instruments that visitors will be able to play without touching. set inside glass cases, the flute, organ, tubular bells, 16-string chinese zither and drum kit are activated by pressing buttons
it's very much a hands-on, discover for yourself exhibit,'' said sculptor richard glassborow. ``on one level it's entertainment; on another level it's seriously stimulating.''
the push buttons give spontaneous but precise control of the robotics that work the instruments. they can pluck out individual notes or create pulsating effects such as vibrato, tremolo or echo
musical phrases, such as a bass line, can be instantly recorded and the playback accompanied by improvisation. the instruments also can be commanded to play a simple preprogrammed tune
it was a choice to make it simple,'' said glassborow. ``if you make it very rich, they (the public) just stand and look at it. we wanted to make it very friendly.''
the flute's robotics are the most impressive, employing the head and pneumatically controlled fingers of a humanoid robot, or android. a valve controls the air that is pumped through the delicately positioned rubber mouthpiece into the lip plate
the instruments took three months to build and were sold to the designers of the museum's soundproof ``cacophony section'' for nearly $87,000
they demonstrate an individual's musical inventiveness and allow those without any musical skills to play music, according to glassborow
tin twin is a more readily recognizable android, with long arms that flit across the keyboard in simulating such smash hits of the thompson twins' as ``doctor doctor'' and ``sister of mercy.''
from a distance, the flashing lights in its eyes and outh give the impression that it is singing along in the chorus
mcandroids is made up of the 39-year-old glassborow; alan dun, a 37-year-old sculptor; engineer john barron, 34; and trevor piper, a 32-year-old artist. the company has found a niche in a fast-growing european market for special effects
in 1986, its three robotic ``french heads,'' composed of odd-shaped pieces of steel and glass fiber on top of tall poles, turned real heads at a robot sculpture display in the georges pompidou center in paris
vaguely resembling outer-space creatures, they turn to watch passers-by, stop and stare back, or babble among themselves in jolly jingles. a museum in glasgow, scotland, is negotiating for display rights
another favorite is a set of nine jack-in-the-box irish caricatures, including a priest, a bar wag and a politician, who pop up at the push of a button to give speeches on the environment. it was bought for an exhibition center in northern ireland's sperrin mountains
the company plans to build an android orchestra, a robotized skeleton riding a bicycle and a mechanical plant that will respond to temperature, light and human activity, such as people quarreling
anyone catching sight of the plant would say, `i know what it's thinking,''' said glassborow. ``this kind of work is a kind of mirror to human behavior.''
at the age of 19, reggae artist ziggy marley has seen enough of the world to know he wants to change it
i am not blind,'' marley says. ``even in jamaica, injustice happened. it happened all over the world. it means something all over the world.''
on the melody makers' new album, ``conscious party,'' marley sings of oppression, bigotry and hope for a better world
for anyone who follows reggae music, marley's political consciousness should come as no surprise. the late bob marley, ziggy's father, was reggae's most celebrated artist and famous for such protest songs as ``get up, stand up'' and ``i shot the sheriff.''
but while acknowledging the legacy of his father, ziggy marley is determined to establish his own identity. ``i want to be fulfilled myself rather than try to follow exactly in my father's footsteps.''
marley was born on october 17, 1968, in trenchtown, an impoverished section of kingston in jamaica. when he was 11, he formed the melody makers along with his brother, stevie, and sisters, cedella and sharon
the melody makers' first song, ``children playing in the streets,'' was written by their father. in 1985, they released their first album, ``play the game right,'' which received a grammy nomination for best reggae record. in 1986, they released the album ``hey world.''
we're brothers and sisters,'' marley said. ``doing music was part of being a family.''
hey world'' contained such overtly political songs as the anti-apartheid ``666,'' and on the new album, he continues to confront injustice with songs such as ``tomorrow people,'' the first single to be released
tomorrow people, think of your past,'' he sings, attacking those who think only of the future and their indifference to humanity
the original idea was from robots, like the movie `robocop' _ people becoming androids,'' marley said. ``scientists are making dangerous things.''
although ``conscious party'' is only marley's third album, he is already attracting the attention of some of the music industry's most highly acclaimed artists. talking heads members chris frantz and tina weymouth produced the record and rolling stones guitarist keith richards plays on the song ``lee and molly.''
lee and molly'' is a story about racial bigotry. lee is a white man who dates molly, a black woman, and is beaten up by his father because of the relationship. the song is based on an actual couple who went to high school in kingston with cedella marley. ``he (lee's father) thought going out with molly set a bad example,'' cedella recalled
ziggy marley identifies strongly with the people of africa. on ``tumbling down,'' he uses the symbols of the eagle, the bear and the lion to warn against the consequences of superpower oppression of the third world
the eagle is the united states and their allies. the bear is the soviet union because of what they've done in ethiopia and afghanistan,'' marley said. ``the lion is africa. bad things are done against my people. consequences will come down on you.''
marley also sings about africa on the ballad ``dream of home.''
home is africa,'' marley said. ``we know that's where we originated from. we have to get rid of (south african president p.w.) botha. through ourselves, our music, we fight apartheid
new love'' is the album's only love song, although it's more about the spiritual quality of love rather than a particular person
my love is always new; it shouldn't get boring,'' marley said. ``love can hurt you, like lee and molly. but new love is like the sun rising. like the morning dew.''
marley is a rastafarian and religion plays an important role in his life and music. on ``a who a sey,'' he attacks those who do not share his belief in a higher being
my religion is a way of life. if i please jah (god), i will please many more people,'' he said
the melody makers started touring in 1975 and have appeared at shows with stevie wonder, the clash, the late peter tosh and jimmy cliff. they performed at reggae sunsplash last august in jamaica. with a worldwide tour scheduled to begin in april, marley is anxious to play his new songs in front of a live audience
it's like relating to people. like me talking to you,'' marley said. ``that is where the people feel the music and feel with you. i'm dealing with people.''
marley hopes his music will help bring about his vision for a better world
we have the obvious,'' he said. ``no war. no pollution. a better life for human beings. no prejudice. everybody has an opportunity. everybody has the basic things
people say they live and then die. i don't believe in death. we believe in live and live. we believe in life. we are the people.''
probably the best development affecting the nation's beleaguered public schools is also among the least noticed: the growing alliance between educators and the business world
at a time when schools have been barraged by critics in the reagan administration and elsewhere, along comes burger king, honeywell, metropolitan life and others in the corporate community who not only are arguing public education's case, but are putting considerable money where their mouths are
a new book, ``american business and the public school: case studies of corporate involvement in public education'' (teachers college press, $24.95), offers a valuable, scholarly dissection of this budding relationship between these formerly estranged bedfellows, and it explodes several myths in the process
the 278-page book was edited by marsha levine, an official of the american federation of teachers, and roberta trachtman, affiliated with the city university of new york. their book argues that self-interest is too simple an explanation for the recent upsurge in corporate interest in better schools
business doesn't get involved in education just because it needs skilled workers,'' argues owen b. ``brad'' butler, retired chairman of procter &amp; gamble who wrote a foreward to the book
most big companies are multinational,'' butler said during a recent visit to new york. ``they can find the workers they need somewhere. the primary interest they have in better schools is that the united states is their home base, and business can't remain healthy unless the united states remains peaceful, prosperous and democratic.''
the book completes a trilogy of studies commissioned by the committee for economic development, a research organization dominated by top business executives which butler chairs. the two earlier reports, ``investing in our children,'' published in 1985, and ``children in need,'' published last september, were each front-page blockbusters
those previous reports, which called for such innovations as massive new governmental investments in programs to help the neediest students, forced all who had typecast business executives as socially callous arch-conservatives to reconsider
the latest book, while not as headline-making, will likely be the most enduring of the three. and like its predecessors, this report challenges some widely held notions about the nature of business-corporate partnerships
it offers, for the first time, useful detailed case histories of business-school partnerships that work, written by insiders. a key ingredient seems to be a new willingness on the part of business to enter such relationships as partners, rather than superiors
metropolitan life's chairman, john creedon, is presented as having ``profound respect for education and educators.'' the company's involvement in school reform has become renowned through, among other things, an annual survey of teacher attitudes it has conducted for the past several years
what's in it for met life? three things, according to the book: its view that it has obligations to the nation as a corporate citizen; its desire to ensure future employees have needed job skills; and a belief that well-informed citizens are better insurance risks
honeywell, the minneapolis-based computer firm, first became interested in education in the 1970s and decided that it had to help local school districts develop better curricula
in seattle, for example, honeywell employees invited citizens in snohomish county, wash., to figure out ways to ``prepare students for a high technology future in a low technology environment.'' the result is a school-business partnership dubbed link
burger king, meanwhile, has developed an awesome array of educational programs since 1983, from fast-food management courses, to scholarship programs and even a curriculum on crime prevention. the company also honors 100 principals and teachers each year. the budget for such programs has grown from $1.5 million in 1983 to $3.9 million in 1986. some 3,000 workers in 900 restaurants have benefitted from the programs
the long-term benefit we are seeking is a consistent, unified public perception of burger king as a good corporate citizen,'' writes burger king's barbara gothard. ``people come to burger king because of quality, service and value. but they are also influenced by their perception of how good is the company backing the product.''
seven or eight years ago, it was difficult to imagine that this would occur, that business and education would become so interested in each other,'' said c. michael timpane, president of columbia teachers college. ``now business isn't just looking at narrow job skills. they realize two things: that people change jobs, and jobs themselves change
when educators looked at that, they thought that this was very congenial. business was asking us to do what we wanted to do all along _ only better.'' for anyone interested in understanding one of the most heartening developments of the 1980s, this book is an excellent place to start
lee mitgang has covered education for the ap since 1981
jim horn has played on records by george harrison, frank sinatra and the beach boys. he's played in movies with elvis presley and spencer tracy
and he's played the theme songs for such tv shows as ``the odd couple'' and ``the courtship of eddie's father.''
harrison, the ex-beatle, recruited him for the historic 1971 concert and movie, ``concert for bangla desh.'' he was part of the famous ``mad dogs and englishmen'' concert tour in 1970 that propelled joe cocker to star status
the public may not have heard of jim horn, but in recording circles in the united states and europe he's a versatile instrumentalist
i've been around awhile and i've been able to do some things,'' he says modestly about his 25-year music career and a resume bulging with achievements
his specialty is the saxophone, but he also plays the flute, piccolo and recorder. over the years, he's played a multitude of other instruments while being associated with many of the top names in show business
he can be heard playing his horn on harrison's latest hit lp, ``cloud nine.''
his (harrison's) singing sounded better than ever,'' horn said in an interview before a recording session with country star hank williams jr. ``and when he plays, you know it's him _ that slide guitar.''
horn worked with another former beatle, paul mccartney, a year ago when mccartney helped produce an album by guitar legend duane eddy
he (mccartney) worked with the musicians well,'' he recalled. ``everyone knew what to do. he was real jovial and funny, cracking jokes. he was fun to work with.''
presley, too, was a free spirit when horn played in the movies ``girls, girls, girls'' and ``roustabout.''
he liked to sit around and play,'' horn said. ``he'd `jam.' he was into karate and he'd break wood when the producer and director weren't around. they didn't like him doing that.''
sinatra, for whom horn played flute on the hit ``strangers in the night,'' was businesslike and a quick worker
he'd rehearse once and then do one take,'' horn recalled. ``he made it relaxed. he was a real pro.''
it was horn's piccolo playing on the beach boys' hit ``good vibrations.''
people like their hawaiian shirts and visualize themselves on the sand with a beer in their hand,'' he said. ``the beach boys make fun music and they didn't let it die.''
horn, who lists his age as ``as old as the beatles,'' was born in compton, calif., and spent most of his life in los angeles. while living there, he played music in the movies ``guess who's coming to dinner'' starring tracy, katharine hepburn and sidney poitier, ``grease,'' ``footloose,'' ``shaft,'' ``stayin' alive'' and many others
he moved to nashville four years ago and is now working on his own album of sax instrumentals, ``neon nights.''
he learned how to play the piano at age 7, the trumpet at age 9 and the sax at age 12
the sax was a real popular instrument when i learned,'' he said. ``there was a sax solo on every record. i wanted my own band and wanted to be able to do solos. i thought they were a whole lot of fun.''
he said he correctly developed his talent and always worked to get better
i practiced a lot as a kid. i learned the proper way to play, then listened to albums, especially the sax solos, and played along with them. it gave me insight. i concentrated on my `ear.'''
even today, he's constantly updating his style and listening to music for trends
i hear songs on the radio and then i may change my style a little,'' horn said. ``but i have the same conviction. some musicians are lazy. they won't buy new equipment. you have to change with the times. it's easier to relate to music that way. i listen to pop and rock on the radio a lot and switch back and forth.''
he owns seven saxes, four flutes and five recorders. his most expensive instrument is a $4,000 baritone sax
despite his success, some instruments have given him trouble. he played the oboe and english horn for records by the carpenters, but later gave them up
they were too demanding,'' he said. ``you had to make your own double reeds. it was too time consuming.''
and he can't master the harmonica, which even school kids can play with little training
i'm trying,'' he admitted. ``i can't get the hang of it. i'm used to blowing out.''

born to be bad'' (rounder) _ george thorogood and the destroyers

albums are really superfluous for george thorogood and the destroyers. this is a bar band, and a very good one, whose music is best heard in a sweaty bar instead of a living room
but commerce calls. thorogood must fulfill a record contract, and ``born to be bad'' is the latest product
if ``born to be bad'' sounds a little familiar, it should. it comes six years after ``bad to the bone.'' what's next _ ``born to be bone?'' or ``born in the badlands?'' how about just plain ``bad?'' maybe that's too familiar
there aren't many things that distinguish ``born to be bad'' from any other george thorogood album since his 1977 debut. the band's sound has become fuller over the years with the addition of a saxophone player and a rhythm guitarist, but the content is largely the same
born to be bad'' has the obligatory chuck berry tune (``you can't catch me''), the traditional sinister guy song (title track), the dance floor stomper (``shake your money maker''), paens to the fairer sex (``i really like girls'') and some blues to highlight thorogood's mean guitar
familiarity doesn't have to breed contempt. the production is crisp and the playing inspired, so most of side 1 genuinely cooks. side 2 flags considerably because of the repetition and one slow blues song too many
do yourself a favor. save the money you may be inclined to spend on ``born to be bad'' until the destroyers happen to come to town. you shouldn't have to wait too long, although they may not duplicate their 1981 feat of playing in 50 states in 50 days. buy a ticket to the concert, grab a dance partner, and have fun

if my heart had windows'' (mca) _ patty loveless

patty loveless' new album consists of 10 songs, and the writing credit is different on each. but loveless' singing and the production of emory gordy jr. and tony brown make the album into a cohesive set that's as country as grits
if my heart had windows'' includes a honky-tonk waltz (the title cut, by dallas frazier); country swing (hank williams' ``i can't get you off of my mind''); and plenty of ballads
loveless' full-throated alto really hits its stride on side 2, climaxing on john and johanna hall's ``fly away,'' which lives up to its name with a soaring chorus reminiscent of the halls' defunct pop group, orleans
the arrangements, built around the solid rhythm section of leland sklar and eddie bayers, include such nice touches as a steel and fiddle playing in unison on the break of ``i can't get you off of my mind.'' the material occasionally sags, but most of the album contains strong and honest performances
_ by steven wine, associated press writer
stand and deliver'' is a kind of thinking man's ``rocky'': melodramatic, full of street-level emotion, with a knockout of an ending that may even convince you that good can occasionally triumph against implausible odds
but what's so special about this movie is that the knockout is scored not with fists, but with the power of young minds
it is an inner city classroom drama based on true events at garfield high school in the east los angeles barrio, a failing school so tough it faced losing its accreditation in 1982
into this mess strides jaime escalante (edward james olmos), a computer specialist who has dropped out of the business world to be a teacher. his first surprise is that the school has no computers. he is assigned to a math class
olmos, whose previous credits include ``zoot suit,'' and an emmy award-winning role as lt. castillo on the tv series ``miami vice,'' is quietly charismatic as a teacher capable of sparring with and inspiring a class of tough hispanic youngsters _ the sort of kids current fashion holds should be ranted at with bullhorns, or expelled
lou diamond phillips, appealing though a bit goody-goody as the late rock sensation richie valens in ``la bamba,'' gives a more complex performance this time around as a wonderfully understated angel, a street gang member finally won over by his dedicated teacher
thanks largely to the crisp direction of ramon menendez, who also co-wrote the screenplay with producer tom musca, it is refreshing to see streetwise, underprivileged children presented as something other than one-dimensional, unreachable monsters
escalante wins over angel and the others with tough humor and personal contact. when they taunt him, he aims his retorts back with devastating accuracy
tough guys don't do math, they fry chicken for a living,'' he tells one macho student
and he relates lessons to his students' ethnic heritage: ``it was your ancestors, the mayans, who first contemplated the concept `zero.' you have math in your blood.''
then he gets a crazy idea: he's going to teach these kids calculus. if they can pass the advanced placement calculus test that would be an almost guaranteed ticket to college and scholarships
what follows is an all-too-authentic portrayal of how a single dedicated teacher is alone in believing that his students can make it. he must face down skeptical parents, fellow teachers _ even investigators from the educational testing service in princeton, n.j
in the end, the students do succeed, but only after a bitter and racist battle with test officials who simply can't accept that barrio kids could perform so well. the school rises from disgrace to national prominence
the ``dedicated-teacher-conquers-tough-kids'' plot is not new to hollywood. glenn ford faced down student sidney poitier in ``the blackboard jungle'' in 1955, and poitier reversed roles as the dedicated teacher in ``to sir with love'' in 1967
stand and deliver'' far exceeds those films in authenticity and dramatic punch. ``stand and deliver'' delivers

italian tire manufacturer pirelli has launched a $1.86 billion offer for firestone tire &amp; rubber co., urging firestone to scrap a plan to sell 75 percent of its tire-making business to bridgestone of japan
pirelli said monday that its offer of $58 a share in cash for firestone's 32 million common shares outstanding was contingent on firestone's dropping the tentative agreement reached with bridgestone just three weeks ago

new reports indicate consumers have increased their borrowing pace and have regained nearly all the confidence they lost as a result of the october stock market crash
two other reports on the employment outlook came to seemingly conflicting conclusions, with the conference board reporting indications of lessening demand for workers and manpower inc. _ a temporary employment concern _ projecting strong hiring this spring
in the consumer credit report, the federal reserve said americans took out $5.42 billion more in installment debt than they paid off in january, the biggest monthly increase in four months and the second strong month in a row
the fed said consumer credit grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.6 percent in january compared to a 7.9 percent annual rate in december and a 5.9 percent rate for all of 1987
consumer credit is regarded as a reflection of trends in consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of u.s. economic growth
consumers apparently are willing to borrow because unemployment was down _ it hit a nine-year low of 5.7 percent in february _ and consumer confidence is rebounding, according to david cross, an economist with the futures group, a washington consulting firm
the conference board, in issuing its monthly consumer confidence index, said consumers have been heartened by continuing strength in the economy
but the private business research organization said consumers also may be feeling more optimistic because their paychecks are larger because of tax cuts that took effect jan. 1
the consumer confidence index was 113.9 points in february, up from january's 109.9 points and 100.8 in november, after the crash
the index, which uses a 1985 base of 100, stood at 115.1 in october, before the oct. 19 stock collapse
the conference board's help wanted index painted a somewhat pessimistic picture of the employment outlook. the index, which reflects the amount of help wanted ads in 51 major newspapers across the nation, declined to 153 in january from 155 in december
the index, which uses a 1967 base of 100, reflects changes in demand for labor and general business conditions
kenneth goldstein, a conference board economist, said the drop in the index signaled a slowdown in hiring plans by employers
in contrast, manpower said a significant number of american companies will bolster hiring this spring
manpower said its employment outlook survey indicated 29 percent of respondents plan to raise employment rolls in the april-june quarter, while 6 percent expect declines. sixty-two percent plan no change and 3 percent don't know, the survey stated
mitchell s. fromstein, manpower's president, said it was the company's strongest spring hiring forecast in four years and suggested manufacturers in all regions of the country are unusually buoyant about the economy
crude oil futures have retreated in response to renewed fears of opec price discounting
on the new york mercantile exchange, contracts for april delivery of west texas intermediate crude oil settled at $15.37 per 42-gallon barrel on monday, down 22 cents from friday's close of $15.59
among refined products, the april contract for wholesale no. 2 heating oil slid 0.13 cent to 43.41 cents. wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.57 cent to 43.94 cents a gallon
i think the catalyst behind today's decline is additional rumors about opec individual nations offering discounts to customers,'' said william byers, an oil analyst with bear, stearns &amp; co
byers said the rumors of price discounting by members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries partly grew out of reports that a delegation from the united arab emirates was visiting tokyo this week
the rumors are really all over the map,'' he said
reports that opec might push for more production controls helped boost prices on friday. shareholder suits</head>
a new supreme court ruling regarding when companies must disclose merger discussions could lead to fewer mergers and hinder corporate competitiveness, according to some legal experts
in the same ruling handed down monday, the court affirmed for the first time a key legal theory strengthening shareholder ability to sue a company for fraud. approval of the so-called fraud-on-the-market theory could spawn a wave of new lawsuits by disgruntled shareholders, lawyers speculated
the ruling stemmed from a case that attracted enormous attention because it raised questions about a company's legal responsibilities regarding disclosure of information that could affect its stock price, including preliminary merger negotiations with another company
the case was considered especially significant because of the wave of mergers that have reshaped corporate america over the past several years. the ability of a company's management to negotiate quickly and discreetly before disclosing a merger proposal has played a key role in that trend
from a company's point of view, the supreme court's ruling certainly is going to make life more difficult,'' said john f. olson, a prominent washington securities lawyer at the firm of gibson, dunn &amp; crutcher. ``it will make companies a lot more cautious about what they say publicly. you're going to see a lot more `no comments.'''
advocates of disclosing merger talks, including the securities and exchange commission, argue that such information is vital to the efficiency and integrity of the financial markets, as reflected by a company's stock price
opponents, including many corporate executives, argue that premature disclosure of merger talks can artificially inflate stock prices, cause a deal to collapse and alert potentially hostile acquirers to a hitherto unknown buyout opportunity
the supreme court's ruling concerned basic inc., a cleveland-based concern that merged with another company in 1978 after its executives denied for months that merger talks were under way
some shareholders who had sold their stock prior to the merger sued the company for fraud, contending its denials of talks had deflated the price. if they had known about the talks, the shareholders argued, they wouldn't have sold
basic executives contended they weren't obligated to disclose the merger talks until they had reached a fundamental agreement
the supreme court rejected both sides' arguments and ordered a separate test for when a company must disclose merger talks. that test measures the probability of whether a merger will occur and must be considered on a case-by-case basis, the court said
attorneys said it was difficult to predict the ultimate consequences of the court's ruling but agreed it could pose serious new problems, particularly in defining the probability of a merger
it's vague in the sense it makes life very difficult,'' said william golub, an attorney for the new york firm of rosenman &amp; colin, which represented basic
at what point does someone decide a merger is probable? the consequence is you either have to say everything, or else you can say `no comment,''' he said
if the chief executives of two companies talk about a merger on the golf course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's probable. but if the issue has to be resolved 10 years later by a jury, it may decide yes, that golf-course meeting was the point of probability,'' golub said
carl liggio, a new york securities lawyer who filed a legal brief on behalf of the defendants, said the high court's ruling could hurt companies and their shareholders
the problem is that when you put businesses in a fishbowl, as you do with hindsight standards of materiality and disclosure, it makes them less competitive,'' liggio said. ``it's more difficult for them to conduct business.''
of possibly more significance, some attorneys said, was the court's endorsement of the fraud-on-the-market theory, which holds that stockholders rely on the the presumed honesty of the market to set a fair price
under this theory, stockholders can sue a company for damages by proving they bought or sold during a time in which the company gave false information or withheld news from the market that would have affected its stock price
although lower courts generally have accepted the theory since its inception in the mid-1970s, this was the first time the high court sanctioned its validity
this is more significant in terms of exposure to litigation,'' golub said. ``it just means this type of lawsuit will continue to grow.''
takeover strategist carl c. icahn says he will keep pressuring texaco inc. to put itself up for sale, but also will support the company's plan for emerging from bankruptcy reorganization
icahn, texaco's largest shareholder, said monday he would drop his attempt to win five seats on texaco's board of directors if the oil giant voluntarily puts itself up for sale at $55 a share
i'm not looking to run texaco. i am looking to enhance all shareholders' value,'' said icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of texaco's stock
icahn is believed to have purchased his stake at prices averaging in the mid- to high- $30 per share range. the stock closed monday at $44.37{, unchanged from friday
icahn met with reporters monday after appearing before a closed meeting of the council of institutional investors, which includes representatives of more than 50 pension funds
among others appearing before the group was texaco's president, james w. kinnear, who said takeover talk stirred by the activities of icahn and others was hampering the company's efforts to restructure itself and prepare for its emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
kinnear said texaco is continuing its efforts to sell unprofitable assets and negotiate partnership agreements on other properties. in addition, the company is seeking short-term loans to help pay creditors when it emerges from bankruptcy protection, which it expects to do in april
we have found that as we go to these negotiations and go to get bank loans, the very presence of corporate raiders makes it very difficult to get the job done,'' kinnear said. ``the banks are terrified. the co-venture partners are concerned.''
icahn said the ``real problem'' was that texaco's management was not sufficiently accountable to its shareholders
he said he would vote for the reorganization plan ``because that's what the shareholders want.'' but he reiterated his dissatisfaction with what he called texaco's ``take-it-or-leave-it plan _ which shareholders must accept or see the company blown up.''
the white plains, n.y.-based company filed for bankruptcy court protection last april to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous bond while appealing a $10.3 billion judgment held against it by pennzoil co
a houston jury awarded the judgment to pennzoil in 1985 after finding texaco interfered with pennzoil's 1984 attempt to acquire part of getty oil co., which texaco later acquired itself
texaco's shareholders have until march 21 to vote on a reorganization plan that would bring the company out of bankruptcy protection and pay a $3 billion out-of-court settlement with pennzoil
earlier this year, icahn failed to win permission from bankruptcy court judge howard schwartzberg on a separate plan that was basically the same but would have stripped away texaco's takeover defenses
icahn later said he would run a slate of five candidates _ including himself _ when the seats come up for a vote at the next texaco annual meeting, expected to take place in may
he has gained the support of another noted takeover strategist, t. boone pickens, also has accumulated texaco shares
icahn said monday he wanted the board seats so he could push his efforts to persuade other board members sell the company voluntarily
if you want to see friendly bids, you'll see plenty. if hostile, i have no idea. (but) if bids start at $55 and if they couldn't get that _ if it couldn't be done in a friendly basis _ i'll agree i was wrong and i'll withdraw my slate,'' he said
wilbur ross, an adviser to texaco's shareholders bankruptcy committee, who also appeared at the meeting, predicted the reorganization plan would be approved overwhelmingly
the mail we've gotten (from small investors) has been running nine or 10 to one in favor,'' he said. ``i don't know of any institutions not in favor _ and the institutions own 40-to-50 percent of the stock.''
potential buyers from italy, canada and the united states are setting their sights on several corporate targets, apparently undaunted by merger agreements that the managements of those targets have reached with other suitors
the moves by general electric co., italy's pirelli societe generale sa and canada's campeau corp. are somewhat reminiscent of texaco inc.'s ill-fated purchase of getty oil co. in 1984
texaco has been in federal bankruptcy court since last april, where it sought refuge rather than post a potentially ruinous bond of more than $10 billion to appeal a texas court's ruling that it illegally had interfered in an agreement by pennzoil co. to buy part of getty
in the past, you fought tooth and nail up to when the company accepted a bid, and once a company accepted a bid it was on to the next game,'' said daniel schwartz, managing director of ulmer brothers inc., a merchant banking firm that specializes in mergers and acquisitions
but clearly that doesn't seem to be the rule anymore,'' he said
ge and pirelli announced their offers monday, while campeau took action last week
the new bidders feel they are on solid legal ground. they all are appealing directly to shareholders of the target companies instead of asking the companies' directors to back out of any agreements
texaco got in trouble because getty was privately-owned, so for texaco to take it over it had to get the getty directors to back out of their deal with pennzoil. texaco argues that getty's deal with pennzoil was not legally binding, but has reached a tentative $3 billion out-of-court settlement of the dispute
the new offers include these deals:
_pirelli offered $1.86 billion for firestone tire &amp; rubber co. on monday even though firestone agreed last month to combine its core tire-making operations with those of japan's bridgestone corp. in a joint venture. pirelli said its offer was contingent on firestone calling off its deal with bridgestone
_general electric, making what it called its first unsolicited takeover bid, offered $423 million monday for roper corp., even though the augusta, ga.-based appliance maker has agreed to be acquired by whirlpool corp. for $352.5 million
_campeau corp., the canadian retailing giant, is pressing its months-long pursuit of cincinnati-based federated department stores inc., despite federated's definitive agreement last week to be acquired by r.h. macy &amp; co. for $6.1 billion. campeau has an outstanding $6.18 billion offer
because of texaco's experience, ``lawyers and their clients are much more careful to not put themselves in a position where someone could claim interference with someone else's agreement,'' said klaus eppler, a partner in the law firm of proskauer rose goetz &amp; mendelsohn
by going straight to the shareholders, the bidders cannot be accused of asking the directors to renege on previous agreements, eppler said
the three offers signify that deals actually are not complete until a buyer's tender offer expires and the acquiring company can actually buy the shares
i'm somewhat at a loss as to why all of a sudden this type of behavior is now acceptable,'' schwartz said
it used to be when you had a done deal, you didn't have people coming in with tender offers. but you've got three of them right here,'' he said
but although the flurry of such deals may be unusual, buyers and sellers typically make arrangements for such eventualities. for example, macy's agreement to buy federated requires federated to pay up $45 million in so-called ``breakup fees'' to macy in the event their deal falls through under certain circumstances
such provisions typically are aimed at discouraging other bidders from making a play for a company that has agreed to be bought out by someone else
a planned management-led buyout of montgomery ward &amp; co. will close mobil corp.'s ill-fated venture into retailing, while giving the venerable retailer a chance to reap all the benefits of its recent successes
montgomery ward said monday that an investor group led by president and chief executive bernard brennan would acquire the company from mobil in a $3.8 billion leveraged buyout
the group, which also includes general electric capital corp., will pay more than $1.5 billion in cash for the 115-year-old, chicago-based company and assume $2.3 billion of its debt
this is a historic day for montgomery ward,'' brennan told a news conference. ``we've gone through an awful lot over the years. ``in 1987, we earned $130 million after taxes. in 1980, we had $162 million loss after taxes.''
faced with a financial drain from the retailer during the early 1980s, mobil _ which acquired montgomery ward in 1976 for about $1 billion _ has wanted to sell the chain for some time. brennan, credited with turning the retailer around in recent years, had been negotiating for months to acquire the company
it's a business that we don't know too well,'' said mobil chairman allen e. murray. he also said new york-based mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, believed it would be best to concentrate on its core businesses
murray said in a telephone interview monday that mobil began receiving inquiries about montgomery ward last summer, but declined to identify the other parties interested in buying the retailer
mobil stock rose $1.12{ to $44.75 in new york stock exchange trading on monday
brennan said ge capital, a unit of general electric co., will take over ward's credit-card operation
in a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out a company and then pay off the debt with the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets
but brennan said the company has no plans to sell other assets or to lay off any employees under the buyout plan, which takes effect in 60 days
we see no need at this time to reduce employment. for example, in chicago, we've added 300 jobs in the last six months,'' brennan said
this is not a leveraged buyout that says, `let's shrink the company.'''
during its comeback effort, montgomery ward laid off 17,000 employees, closed its jefferson ward discount stores and other unprofitable branches, and shut down the catalog division that dated back to the company's early days
it moved into specialty retailing, opening appliance and electronics stores, and is converting its department stores to emphasize specialty formats including electronics, home furnishings and recreational items
last month, montgomery ward announced it was realigning its field-office management to create new specialty retailing positions
our customers are middle america. we don't want to be too avant garde, and we don't want to be downscale.'' said brennan, a former executive of chicago-based sears, roebuck and co
consumers have the advantage that we have people running the business that owns the business,'' brennan said. ``independence gives us much more flexibility.''
mobil has not indicated what it would do with the money from the sale. energy analyst bruce lazier, of the investment firm prescott, ball &amp; turben, said he believed corporate capital investment will receive the largest share
my guess is that, that will reduce their short-term debt and that gives them an extra $2 billion of funds available number one for reinvestment in capital expenditures if the opportunities arise and, number two, gives them flexibility to increase dividends and share repurchase plans,'' lazier said in a telephone interview
martin l. longstreth jr., who worked his way up from clerk to chairman of the philadelphia stock exchange, has died of cancer. he was 42
longstreth died in his home sunday, just 2{ months after he was diagnosed as having cancer, his family said
the stock exchange board will name a successor within several months, president nick giordano said monday
after graduating from villanova university in 1967 with a bachelor of science degree, longstreth spent two years in an executive training program with a philadelphia bank before entering the securities business
he spent a year in the retail end of the business before becoming a clerk on the floor of the philadelphia exchange
longstreth worked as an options special and floor broker from 1972 to 1980. he served as senior vice president of the philadelphia stock exchange from 1974-75, in charge of floor surveillance for equities and options. he was named chairman of the exchange in march 1984
he is survived by his wife, francis, and nine children
gillette co. is urging its shareholders to reject an attempt by a new york-based investment partnership to oust four company directors at next month's annual meeting
colman mockler jr., gillette's chairman and chief operating officer, said in a statement mailed monday to shareholders that coniston partners intended to sell or dismantle gillette if the hostile takeover succeeds
the principals of coniston group have no experience in directing or running a worldwide manufacturing or consumer goods company as an ongoing enterprise,'' stated mockler. ``the board of directors believes that the objective of coniston group is to force the immediate sale or dismemberment of gillette.''
coniston controls 6.76 million gillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's shares outstanding, and has indicated it wanted the company to boost its stock price either by restructuring or negotiating a merger with another party
mockler contended the company's major restructuring in 1986, the result of repeated takeover attempts by revlon group inc., had helped enhance shareholder values. mockler said gillette's earnings per share rose a record 41 percent in 1987
coniston, through two subsidiaries, is seeking to solicit a majority of shareholders to elect four nominees to the gillette board at the april 21 meeting in boston. one of the seats up for election is mockler's
gillette shares rose 12{ cents to close at $40.75 monday on new york stock exchange trading
gus oliver, a principal of coniston partners, said letters explaining the group's proposal should be mailed to shareholders later this week
monday was the final day for shareholders to qualify to vote at the annual meeting
gillette underwent a major restructuring after rebuffing a third hostile takeover bid by revlon, which agreed not to seek to gain control of gillette under a 10-year pact signed in november 1986
following the accord, gillette laid off about 2,400 workers and sold off a several sudsidiaries and discontinued unprofitable divisions, including a line of high-quality writing instruments and 28 percent interest in eye world stores
gillette spokesman david fausch said further cutbacks in some international operations, such as cosmetics and beauty aids, are planned as part of the restructuring
coniston last year was instrumental in forcing a major restructuring of allegis corp., the parent of united airlines
separately on monday, gillette said it had received notification that new york real estate developer donald trump had received federal trade commission clearance to increase his holdings of the company's stock
trump now may purchase up to 24.9 percent of gillette's stock. trump owns about 400,000 shares, which was less than three-tenths of 1 percent of gillette's 115 million common shares outstanding
a gillette statement monday said the company has not received any communications from trump
a financial restructuring of shoney's inc. means $730 million for stockholders who will receive one-time dividends of $20 in cash and stock for each of their shoney's shares, officials said
this is not giving up, this is a fresh start,'' according to mitchell boyd, vice chairman and chief executive officer of the nashville-based restaurant chain
financing of the recapitalization will be through cash and about $600 million in bank borrowings through a syndicate headed by the canadian imperial bank of commerce, boyd said sunday
shareholders will receive $16 per share in cash and a subordinated debenture with a face value of $4 for each share of shoney's stock they own, and will retain ownership of the stock
shareholders will not receive dividends but will receive interest of 48 cents on each note, compared to the 18 cents per share dividends received last year
company chairman ray danner, who started the 1,400-restaurant chain in 1959, stands to receive about $110 million in cash for his 6.9 million shares. retired senior chairman alex schoenbaum, founder of the concept, owns about 3.2 million shares and would receive about $51 million
the two own 28 percent of the outstanding stock of shoney's, which had revenue last year of $694 million
shareholder approval is not required for the plan, but the board of directors decided sunday to submit the proposal to shareholders because of its massive scope
the recapitalization plan is designed to shift the company's emphasis from growth through physical expansion to growth through improved profit margins at existing locations, boyd said
the plan will also allow the founders to cash out, while leaving them as major owners of the stock for the next few years, and provide incentives to the second generation of top management, boyd said
the plan permits executives to immediately cash in all outstanding stock options and would set aside an additional 1 million shares for management stock options over the next several years, allowing management to own up to 17 percent of the company
president miguel de la madrid urged producers and businesses to hold down prices this month, saying it ``will be decisive for the success'' of his anti-inflation program
our goal is not only to reduce inflation in march, but to continue dominating this harmful phenomenon the rest of the year,'' the president said monday in a speech broadcast nationwide over radio and television
de la madrid said his program, called the economic solidarity pact, had brought down inflation, allowed for a budget surplus and reduced government use of public credit, bringing down interest rates
inflation for february is expected to be about 8 percent, or about half the 15.5 percent registered in january, he said. consumer prices rose 8.7 percent in the first half of february and inflation was a record 159.2 percent in 1987
today i can affirm with satisfaction that the basic commitments of the pact are being fulfilled by ... workers, businessmen and the government,'' he said
he said the government had increased its income while cutting spending through reinforced austerity measures
the budget surplus, not counting debt service payments, meant the government used less public credit and lightened pressure on interest rates, he said
the minimal variation in the value of the peso currency against the dollar from december 15 to february 21 also helped reduce inflation, he said
the peso stood monday at 2,330 to the dollar on the free market, compared with 2,286 a month ago. the rate is used for tourism and most border transactions. a second rate, the controlled rate, used for 75 percent of all transactions, closed at 2,241 to the dollar, compared with 2,205 a month ago
with the start of the second phase of the plan march 1, treasury secretary gustavo petricioli announced that both rates, which had been sliding against the dollar, would remain unchanged this month
prices of government price-controlled items, which include gasoline, electricity and basic foods, were frozen for the month and a wage increase for the month held to 3 percent, below what had been expected
the minimum wage rose march 1 to 8,000 pesos a day or about $3.50
budget secretary pedro aspe told a meeting of state financial officials on sunday that the stabilization of the economy now was ``within reach.''
letting up on the inflation fight, he said, would mean a reversal of the gains achieved so far
aspe told the state financial officials that the government's program did not constitute a ``shock'' plan, the name given to drastic measures taken by brazil and argentina to rid their economies of hyper-inflation
mexico's plan, he said, does not include a ``generalized control of prices and salaries'' such as other countries have imposed
a federal judge will decide after reviewing a psychiatrist's report whether an arbitrageur accused of plotting to kill convicted stock speculator ivan f. boesky should be turned over to a psychiatric facility in new jersey
u.s. district judge whitman knapp extended an order monday placing john a. mulheren in manhattan's metropolitan correctional center, a federal detention facility, until wednesday, when knapp is to examine the report of the psychiatrist, dr. naomi goldstein
detention hearings were being held to determine if mulheren should be released on bail, held by federal authorities or turned over to a psychiatric facility recommended by his attorneys
late saturday, u.s. district judge pierre leval ordered mulheren to remain at the mcc after federal magistrate kathleen a. roberts ordered earlier in the day that mulheren be released to the carrier foundation in new jersey
the government had argued that the new jersey facility was not secure enough to hold mulheren, senior partner at jamie securities co
mulheren, 38, of rumson, n.j., was detained feb. 18 on a federal criminal complaint that he threatened to kill boesky, a central figure in the government's investigation of insider trading on wall street, and michael davidoff, boesky's former head trader
according to police reports, mulheren was carrying weapons and ammunition while making threats against the men, who might be witnesses against mulheren
we feel he has to be in a secure facility. there's a real possibility mr. mulheren will get out and do it again,'' the assistant u.s. attorney handling the case, robert gage, told the court
mulheren's lawyers argue that he is a manic-depressive who had failed on the day of his arrest to take lithium, a drug prescribed to control extreme mood swings and impulses
at the hearing, they presented testimony from the arresting police officers who had grown up with mulheren and other testimony that indicated mulheren was a model citizen and not a threat to society
defense attorneys also said they were concerned about mulheren's health and wanted him where he could receive better care
knapp initially appeared to be against having mulheren examined by a psychiatrist. but he later changed his mind and ruled that mulheren should be examined by goldstein, a manhattan psychiatrist with whom knapp is familiar and whom the government had suggested
goldstein will be allowed to review mulheren's records and interview his attorneys and wife. however, knapp stipulated that information from the psychiatrist would not be used in a court unless the trial judge so ordered. information from the wife was not to be used in court at all
at the 2 p.m. hearing wednesday, knapp will review the initial impressions of goldstein about mulheren's behavior potential and decide whether to send the case back to roberts or send the defendant to the new jersey facility
a federal judge says he'll order new delegate elections at 68 united auto workers local unions in the southwest following reports of irregulatites in the campaign and election
u.s. district judge richard suhrheinrich said monday new elections will be ordered in the contested 1986 race between incumbent uaw region 5 director kenneth worley and his top assistant, jerry tucker
tucker was fired after he announced in may 1986 that he was entering the race against worley. tucker lost by two-tenths of a vote, but nearly 27 votes in the contest were challenged
the u.s. department of labor investigated the election and filed three lawsuits against the uaw, charging that some illegal delegates voted in the august election, that tucker was fired illegally and that worley illegally used union money for an individual campaign
worley spent $13,000 in union money to buy jackets for delegates to the uaw's constitutional convention in august 1986, where they voted for regional directors and other union officers. the jackets bore the region's number and worley's name
members in other regions bought their own jackets, as did tucker's region 5 supporters, said tucker's attorney, joseph yablonski
the labor department investigation also found that worley sent out campaign fliers typed on a uaw typewriter on uaw stationary in a uaw office, which also is illegal for an individual's campaign, said labor department attorney janet graney
the uaw declined comment until it receives the order
the order, requiring new delegate elections in the eight-state region, would end at least part of a 21-month legal battle by tucker and the labor department
region 5 includes uaw locals in missouri, kansas, oklahoma, arkansas, texas, louisiana, colorado and new mexico. after new delegates are elected for each local, they will vote at a mini-convention for a regional director
frank perdue, the 67-year-old head of perdue farms inc., is stepping down from his post, but says he will remain directly involved in managing the large poultry company
donald w. mabe, a 30-year veteran of the company who most recently served as vice chairman and president, has replaced perdue as president and chief executive officer, according to a company statement
the change will relieve perdue, associated by many television commercial watchers with his motto, ``it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken,'' from many day-to-day executive duties, the firm said late last week. but he plans to work directly with mabe
in other appointments, perdue's son, james a. perdue, vice president of the company's quality improvement division, was named to the chairman's committee, the top policy-making body, and pelham b. lawrence, vice president and chief financial officer, was elected to the board of directors
mabe, who joined perdue in 1957 as a broiler service supervisor, has been broiler marketing specialist, director of broiler sales and service, director of the hatching-egg program and production manager of the firm. in 1967 he was named vice president and general manager of processing and in 1972 he was appointed executive vice president of the company. elected to the board of directors in 1963, he was named president in 1979 and vice chairman in 1984
james perdue joined the family business in 1983 as a management trainee. he has served as a foreman, quality control coordinator and plant manager in salisbury, as well as quality control manager for the company's delmarva operations. he was named vice president of quality improvement in 1987 and has been on the board of directors since 1979. president</head>
philadelphia electric co. chairman james l. everett iii is retiring and will be replaced by joseph f. paquette jr., a former philadelphia electric executive who is currently president of a michigan utility
the changes, announced by philadelphia electric on monday, came as the utility struggles to restart its peach bottom nuclear plant that was shut down by the federal government last year
everett, 61, said monday he would retire at philadelphia electric's april 13 board meeting, when paquette is to be elected his successor. paquette will serve as philadelphia electric's president until everett's retirement
everett will remain on the utility's board as chairman of the executive committee
paquette, 53 is president and chief operating officer of cms energy corp., the jackson, mich.-based parent of consumers power in jackson, mich. he previously spent 30 years at philadelphia electric and held a number of management positions
everett's job had been in jeopardy since the nuclear regulatory commission decided last march 31 to close the peach bottom plant after control room operators were found sleeping and playing video games on the job
his pending retirement follows the departure last month of philadelphia electric president john h. austin
william shane, chairman of the pennsylvania public utility commission, had called for everett's resignation. he said monday he was delighted with the latest changes
the utility also announced monday that corbin a. mcneill jr. will become its executive vice president for nuclear operations next week. mcneill, 48, will be responsible for directing the company's nuclear operations, including the nuclear department's reorganization and efforts to get nrc approval to restart the york county power plant
philadelphia electric must assure the nrc that it can operate the plant safely before the agency will allow peach bottom's two reactors to restart
philadelphia electric submitted part of a new restart plan on nov. 25, outlining management changes at peach bottom and at the limerick nuclear plant in montgomery county. on feb. 12, philadelphia electric submitted the second half
in the plan, the company promised to provide more and better-trained plant operators, a new management team at the plant and a better employee value system
the nrc has found a list of deficiencies in the plant's operations, including the release of mildly radioactive water into the susquehanna river, misclassification of radioactive waste shipment and poor implementation of fire requirements
the shutdown is costing philadelphia electric and its three partners in the plant about $14 million a month to buy replacement power
peach bottom was opened in 1974 and is owned by philadelphia electric, public servcie electric &amp; gas co., of newark, n.j.; atlantic electric co., of atlantic city, n.j.; and delmarva power &amp; light co., of wilmington, del

general electric co.'s unsolicited bid to acquire appliance-maker roper corp. _ which already has agreed to a merger with rival whirlpool corp. _ is seen as a competitive move in a consolidating industry
ge on monday offered to pay $45 a share, or $423 million, for roper's 9.4 million common shares outstanding
the unsolicited offer _ the first ever by ge _ topped the whirlpool offer of $37.50 a share, or $352.5 million, agreed to last month by roper
analysts applauded the move by ge, the well-known appliance maker which also has major interests in finance, broadcasting and other manufacturing, which was seen as a thrust against a competitor in the major appliance field
it makes sense and the numbers look real good,'' said nicholas heymann, a vice president of drexel burnham lambert inc. in new york. ``in terms of what they're getting, they're trying to make a statement with the price.''
roper's stock soared $11 to $48.37{ a share in composite new york stock exchange trading monday, indicating that speculators expected a higher offer to emerge. ge fell 75 cents a share to $43.37{ and whirlpool dropped 62{ cents a share to $28.75
roper, which is based in augusta, ga., makes gas and electric ranges, including some of the ranges marketed by ge
heymann said ge had carved out a niche in the gas range market within the past three years, and was no. 3 in that business with 15 percent of the market
this year they are revamping the range line and i think they would like to be vertically integrated in the gas line,'' heymann said. ``if they expand, they could vertically integrate and could move up to 20 or 25 percent of the market.''
it appears the ball is back in whirlpool's court,'' heymann said
roper, based in augusta, ga., said today it would meet with ge representatives and give the company information it had requested. roper said it would inform its shareholders of the board's position on the ge offer on or before march 18
whirlpool expects to received the detailed ge offer today, said donna mclean, a spokeswoman for benton harbor, mich.-based whirlpool
right now, we're right where we were. we have not said we're going to up the ante at all,'' mclean said
in a statement monday, david whitwam, whirlpool's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company was still committed to acquiring roper as a major step in its growth strategy
russ leavitt, a senior analyst for salomon brothers inc. in new york, said the merger attempt gives ge a ``potentially strengthened position in the cooking business.''
it also gives them an entree to sears, which is a major appliance retailer where ge has not been involved,'' leavitt said, referring to sears, roebuck &amp; co. ``roper is a sears supplier of cooking products and in the past ge has sold very little to sears. it could help them get into that market.''
ge said it made the offer after learning from a securities and exchange commission filing that roper agreed to the whirlpool merger under threat of a ``unilateral takeover.''
ge said that in discussions with roper management last year, roper officials said they wanted the company to remain independent
we concluded that because we approached roper on a friendly basis and because roper had been forced into play by the whirlpool offer, we should make an offer,'' said jack batty, a spokesman for ge. ``we would describe our offer as competitive.''
batty also noted the industry consolidation stemming from stepped up competition. other major appliance mergers in recent years included maytag corp.'s acquisition of magic chef co. and the acquisition of white consolidated industries by sweden's electrolux ab
we feel that it would significantly strengthen ge's appliance business in an increasingly competitive global market,'' batty said. ``we became impressed with the quality of their products. ...we think it would enhance our competitive position.''
ge's tender offer expires april 1. whirlpool's offer expires march 25
in its fiscal year ended last july 31, roper had net income of $24 million on $703 million in sales. gas and electric ranges account for about 40 percent of sales
ge had 1987 revenue of $40.5 billion and net income of $2.9 billion. ge's major appliance business last year had a pretax operating profit of $490 million on $4.72 billion in revenue

hundreds of scientists plan to gather wednesday to help design a $456 million machine that will generate the most intense x-ray beams in the world, the laboratory's director says
the scientists, who are coming from some of the nation's major industries and universities, will gather at argonne national laboratory near suburban lemont
alan schriesheim, argonne's director, said president reagan allotted $12.6 million in his proposed fiscal 1989 budget to the research, development and construction at argonne of the machine _ called a synchroton
congress has not yet passed the funding for the project. but schriesheim said he is optimistic lawmakers will approve the funding because of the synchroton's ``extraordinary variety'' of applications in pure science and industry
the machine would produce the most intense and powerful x-ray beams ever generated and will be used to help scientists explain the interior of matter, schriesheim said in a telephone interview monday night
industry has taken a keen interest in the development of the machine, named the 7gev advanced photon source
the machine has already attracted more industrial participation in the planning and design stages than any basic research machine ever built in the country,'' said david baurac, an argonne spokesman
some of the 7gev advanced photon source's applications would be in the petroleum, bio-medical, semiconductor, computer and airplane industries, schriesheim said
future applications might include the creation of a plastic stronger than steel, faster computer chips and improved diagnosis of heart disease, he said
international business machines corp of armonk, n.y, american telephone &amp; telegraph co. of new york, boeing co. of seattle, and exxon corp. of new york are among the businesses expected to attend the two-day meeting to help design the machine to meet their needs, schriesheim said
three hundred scientists are expected to attend the meeting, baurac said
argonne hopes to begin constructing the machine in late 1988 or early 1989. the machine will take about seven years to build, and its construction would generate 1,500 jobs, baurac said
once built, 300 scientists and technical staff members would run the machine, and about 1,000 scientists from industry, universities and other laboratories would use it each year, baurac said
the synchroton works by taking positrons and accelerating them almost to the speed of light. the synchroton then uses sophisticated arrays of magnets to wiggle the beam violently to generate ``the brightest beams of x-rays in the world'', baurac said
positrons are ``like electrons with positive charges,'' baurac said
grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly higher today on the chicago board of trade
soybean futures showed the greatest strength, gaining from follow-through buying from monday and from a lack of farmer selling overnight, analysts said

corn futures advanced on news that the soviet union had purchased 300,000 metric tons of u.s. corn for delivery in the current marketing year, which began sept. 1

the positive news was that the agency had sold just 1.6 million bushels of wheat in friday's auction. but the usda also said it would continue its schedule of thrice-weekly auctions, each with a target of 10 million bushels, through march 25
in early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with the contract for delivery in march at $3.05{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent higher with march at $2.01} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent higher with march at $1.91{ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with march at $6.15 a bushel

firestone tire &amp; rubber co. management's rejection of a merger with pirelli in favor of a venture with bridgestone corp. set the stage for the italian tiremaker's $1.86 billion tender offer for firestone, pirelli's chief says
pirelli societe generale sa, the world's fifth-largest tire maker, began negotiating at firestone's request over a merger of their tire operations in october 1986, pirelli chief executive gianbattista digiorgia said monday
the talks broke up with no agreement last march but resumed early last month, digiorgia said in a telephone interview from new york
we had a talk with them in the beginning of february, making a proposal that seemed to us to have been accepted,'' digiorgia said. ``a couple days later they announced the preliminary agreement with bridgestone.''
pirelli said its offer monday of $58 cash a share for firestone's 32 million common shares outstanding was contingent on firestone's dropping the tentative agreement reached with bridgestone on feb. 16
that agreement, calling for the japanese tire manufacturer to buy 75 percent of firestone's tire-making business for $1.5 billion, left pirelli ``no choice'' but to make an offer directly to firestone's shareholders, the italian company said in a statement
pirelli's offer also was conditioned on pirelli's acquiring at least two-thirds of firestone's shares in the tender offer and on the removal of firestone's anti-takeover defenses, pirelli said
if pirelli acquires control of firestone, it will sell certain segments of the company to french tire manufacturer michelin
john j. nevin, chairman of chicago-based firestone, stated late monday that the company's board was reviewing the offer and asking shareholders to await its recommendation before deciding whether to tender their stock to pirelli
the board will complete its review by march 18, nevin said
firestone stock shot up $13.50 a share to $63.12{ in composite new york stock exchange trading monday, topping pirelli's $58-a-share offer in reflection of speculation that a higher offer might emerge
pirelli had been regarded as a possible suitor for firestone, and just before firestone announced its bridgestone agreement speculation was rampant that a bid was about to be made
lawyers for pirelli on monday went to u.s. district court in cleveland to try to stop firestone from enforcing the ohio takeover act and from using its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover measures. a poison pill is a move by a takeover target company to make its stock less attractive to a potential acquirer
judge alice batchelder denied pirelli's request for a temporary restraining order and set a hearing for next monday to review the constitutionality of the ohio takeover laws
acquisition of firestone, the world's fourth-largest tiremaker, substantially would increase pirelli's current 1.5 percent share of the u.s. tire market, the world's largest. it also would give the italian company its first u.s. manufacturing facilities
it is known in our strategy that we need production facilities in the states,'' digiorgia said
we are present in eight countries so far,'' he said. ``it can be good for us to have a major presence in the states in order to improve our overall presence in the marketplace.''
analysts said acquiring firestone's u.s. tire business would be the easiest way for a foreign manufacturer to establish a solid foothold in the u.s. market and remain a contender in the fiercely competitive global industry
firestone is the only game in town for a tire company located outside the united states that wants to get in in a big way,'' said donald descenza of nomura securities international inc. in new york
firestone's got the plants, the distribution system and the relationships with general motors, ford and chrysler,'' he said
firestone has about 21 percent of the lucrative u.s. original-equipment market for passenger cars, said ed noga, editor of rubber &amp; plastics news, an akron, ohio-based trade journal
goodyear holds 34 percent of that market, uniroyal 20 percent, general 13 percent, and michelin 11 percent, noga said
firestone ranked fourth among tiremakers worldwide in 1986 sales of tires alone, behind goodyear, michelin and bridgestone, noga said
pirelli, based in milan, was fifth with 1987 sales of $3.65 billion
under the plan to spin off parts of firestone to michelin, the french group would pay about $650 million for firestone's brazilian holdings and its master care inc. auto service business, pirelli stated
michelin also would have an option to buy 50 percent of firestone's synthetic rubber and diversified product holdings in the united states for about $150 million
on feb. 16, bridgestone and firestone said they intended to form a new akron-based business called firestone tire co. that would own firestone's worldwide tire-making operation
bridgestone would own 75 percent of the joint venture
non-opec oil-producing countries are scheduled to meet in london on wednesday to consider ways of stabilizing world oil prices, egypt's top petroleum official said
in a statement distributed tuesday by the state-run middle east news agency, oil minister abdel-hady kandil said egypt called the conference to discuss ``deteriorating conditions in the world oil market.''
he said conferees planned to discuss ``means of halting the decline in prices and the best way to help producing countries, both inside and outside opec, maintain a steady income.''
kandil said it was not known how long the meeting would last. he also said it was not directed against the 13-member organization of petroleum exporting countries
besides egypt, participants will include the soviet union, china, norway, angola, malaysia, brunei, oman and mexico, kandil said
in stockholm, however, a norwegian oil ministry spokesman was quoted as saying that norway had declined an invitation to attend the meeting
the spokesman said norway remained resolute in its commitment to support opec in seeking stable oil prices, despite the recent downturn on world markets
tandon corp. said tuesday it has sold off the disk-drive business on which the company was founded to western digital corp. for $49 million in cash and other considerations
western digital, of irvine, a leading maker of computer storage, communications, video controller and logic-processing units, also will assume about $28 million in tandon liabilities, the companies said
the deal, which was agreed to in december and completed tuesday, involves tandon's winchester disk drive engineering and manufacturing facilities in santa clara and san jose, calif., and singapore, as well as plated media operations in santa clara
tandon, based in chatsworth, will be left with its fledgling business of manufacturing its own line of personal computers
as part of the deal, tandon agreed to buy western digital products to meet its production needs for at least two years
the acquisition of tandon's disk-drive operations gives western digital a business whose revenues grew to $280 million in 1987 from $78 million in 1985
class action suits have been filed against de laurentiis entertainment group inc. and its founder, italian film producer dino de laurentiis, charging the defendants with securities laws violations
the suits claim the defendants sold millions of dollars worth of securities to the public, while misrepresenting or failing to disclose information that would have been important to the investors who bought them
the plaintiffs charged that the company's directors and others ``participated in the wrongdoing in order to continue and prolong the illusions of the company's success as a financier, producer, distributor and exploiter of theatrical motion pictures.''
they also contend that de laurentiis' management wasted corporate assets in lavish spending and knowingly raised ``public funds for such purposes.''
they claim the film company failed to inform investors that de laurentiis, the former chairman of the entertainment group, received more than $300,000 for use of a beverly hills mansion and a rolls royce, the suit said
it is unfortunate that investors have seen more than $89 million of their money being lost,'' said richard d. greenfield, a haverford, pa., attorney representing the plaintiffs. the suits were filed monday in superior court
the suits were filed on behalf of those who purchased de laurentiis securities between may 30, 1986 and june 22, 1987. the securities included $65 million worth of notes and more than 2 million shares of common stock
de laurentiis group attorney robert goldsmith declined comment, saying he was unaware of the court action
the 68-year-old de laurentiis stepped down from his post as chairman and chief executive of the entertainment group last month so that the company, which has been hit by a string of box-office flops, could proceed with restructuring
the company posted losses of $36.2 million for the nine months ended nov. 30. it's failing films included ``near dark,'' ``weeds,'' ``hiding out,'' and ``date with an angel.''
the suits, which seeks unspecified damages, also name painewebber inc., the company's underwriter, and an active promoter of its securities

gulf &amp; western inc., the entertainment, publishing and financial services giant, said its first-quarter profit slipped 8.9 percent compared with strong results a year earlier
martin s. davis, chairman and chief executive, said tuesday the results were in line with the company's expectations and that he expected improvement for all of fiscal 1988
the company said its profit fell to $63.1 million, or $1.05 a share, in its first fiscal quarter ended jan. 31 compared with earnings of $69.3 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier
revenue for the first quarter rose 8.3 percent, to $1.18 billion from $1.09 billion a year earlier
operating income from motion pictures for the quarter was down from record results for the christmas holiday quarter a year earlier, when the company had the movies ``star trek iv: the voyage home,'' ``the golden child'' and ``crocodile dundee'' in u.s. theaters and ``top gun'' in foreign release
this year, the company had the movies ``eddie murphy raw'' and ``fatal attraction'' in u.s. theaters and ``beverly hills cop ii'' and ``the untouchables'' in international release
television operations reported higher operating income. gulf &amp; western produces television programs such as ``cheers,'' operates the madison square garden cable tv network and owns 50 percent of the usa cable network
consumer publishing results were strong, but the costs of product development depressed results from educational publishing and professional information services
consumer and commercial finance operations improved, as a result of increased finance charge revenue and gains from insurance operations as well as gains in credit card receivables and real estate lending
davis said one reason for his optimism about prospects for earnings growth later this fiscal year is the planned release of the films ``crocodile dundee ii'' and ``coming to america'' with eddie murphy and revenue from syndication of the television shows ``cheers,'' ``webster'' and ``family ties.''
the company also announced it had boosted its quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share from 30 cents a share, payable april 1 to shareholders of record march 18. in addition, gulf &amp; western declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend, payable may 2 to shareholders of record april 8
bankers trust new york corp., the nation's eighth-largest bank holding company, said monday it will establish a major operation in edinburgh, scotland, to provide global custody facilities for british and european owners and managers of large investment funds
scottish office industry minister and member of parliament ian lang, said through the scottish development agency here that the move is an important boost for the expanding financial services industry in scotland
bankers trust already has 400 employees in scotland through its acquisition last august of edinburgh-based world markets company, which provides global financial information services. the new operation will add another 150 jobs
a spokesman for the scottish development agency's north american offices, said that more than $158 billion in funds is managed in scotland, making it the second-largest financial services sector behind london in the european economic community

corning glass works said tuesday that it has agreed to acquire international clinical laboratories in a cash deal valued at around $260 million
chairman james houghton said he hoped the merger would broaden corning's laboratory services. the company said it planned to combine nashville-based international clinical with its laboratory subsidiary, mepath inc
corning said it offered $26 a share for 3 million unissued shares of international clinical stock and has an option to buy all of the shares owned by certain directors and officers of the company
the deal, which is set to expire by march 28, is subject to federal approval and to corning acquiring a majority of international clinical's shares
international clinical operates 13 major laboratories, mainly in the south and west, and had sales of $205 million last fiscal year and net income of $4.8 million
besides laboratory services, corning makes consumer housewares, optical fibers and other telecommunications equipment, and specialty glass and ceramics
its metpath subisidiary, which is based in teterboro, n.j., has about a dozen testing labs nationwide
grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed tuesday on the chicago board of trade, with wheat and corn futures ending lower while soybeans advanced
the substantial losses in wheat futures were due to heavy speculative selling stemming from a lack of major new export business, analysts said
an agriculture department report showing the u.s. winter wheat crop in good to fair condition was also seen as bearish for wheat prices
and the usda announced late monday it would continue through march 25 its thrice-weekly auctions of government-held wheat, another negative factor for wheat prices
soybean futures advanced on indications of rising world demand for vegetable oils, analysts said
most corn futures contracts finished fractionally lower in quiet trading
i guess corn was kind of trapped between beans being up and wheat being down,'' said jerry gidel, an analyst for g.h. miller &amp; co. in chicago
at the close, wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents lower with the contract for delivery in march at $3 a bushel; corn was 1\ cent lower to } cent higher with march at $2.01{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with march at $1.92 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4} cents higher with march at $6.17 a bushel
stocks strengthened broadly today in heavy trading, helped by dividend-related buying strategies, takeover speculation and a desire by institutional money managers to improve first-quarter portfolio performances
the market for the last couple of weeks has been extremely constructive,'' said philip c. puccio, manager of institutional trading at dillon read &amp; co. in new york. ``the institutions have been more willing to invest money sitting on the sidelines.''
trading designed to capture high-yielding dividends of utility stocks accounted for much of the volume. a surge in speculative trading in stocks of companies possibly targeted for takeovers also contributed to the busy pace
share prices on the london stock exchange closed lower tuesday but above their worst levels after prime minister margaret thatcher ruled out an early cut in bank base lending rates
the market's attention once again was dominated by the strength of the british pound on foreign-exchange markets. trading volume was light in most shares
at the close, the financial times-stock exchange 100-share index was down 3.2 points at 1815.0. the index fell as much as 9.4 points in response to mrs. thatcher's statements, but then recovered somewhat on the strength of early gains on wall street
volume was 420.9 million shares, up slightly from 404.8 million on monday
the pound's strength sparked concern about the competitiveness of british exports
but mrs. thatcher told the house of commons the government didn't intend to lower interest rates to curb the pound's strength, for fear of spurring inflation
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 24.70 points to 2,081.07, the highest level since the october stock market crash

prices for future delivery of cocoa rose tuesday as a new price-support scheme emerged from an international meeting in london, but analysts said the plan was unlikely to halt the slide in prices
on other markets, cattle futures advanced sharply while the pork complex was mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; precious metals retreated; energy futures were mostly higher; and stock-index futures advanced
the international cocoa organization's failure to reach agreement on a new price-support plan after five days of meetings triggered the automatic implementation of a scheme allowing the icco to withhold up to 120,000 metric tons from the market
but the organization lacks sufficient funding to finance the plan and its members, representing consumer and producer nations, were sharply divided on what intervention price should trigger the withholding mechanism, analysts said
it's very questionable whether the withholding program will have any impact on the market,'' said kim badenhop, an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc
the spot price for cocoa has fallen more than $400 a metric ton since july due primarily to abundant supplies and rising production
the icco intervened with a buffer-stock buying program that began in january, but the organization exhausted the program's 250,000-metric-ton allocation within two months
the first news of the new price-support plan sparked a rally on new york's coffee sugar &amp; cocoa exchange, where the contract for march delivery settled $17 higher at $1,600 a metric ton
but badenhop said trading enthusiasm flagged on later reports explaining the problems with the plan
cattle futures posted impressive gains for the second consecutive session on the chicago mercantile exchange in reaction to higher cash prices for cattle, carcasses and boxed beef, analysts said
the cattle market had been depressed due to a lenten-season drop in consumer demand for meat. but a wave of packing plant closings last week has reduced beef supplies to the point where wholesale prices have begun to rise, said william j. arndt, an analyst in chicago for dean witter reynolds inc
some concern remains that the drop in slaughters will lead to a backlog of slaughter-ready animals but ``right now we're trading the cash and the cash is strong,'' arndt said
hog futures followed cattle higher while frozen pork belly futures retreated on an exchange report showing an unexpectedly steep increase in supplies, he said
live cattle settled .20 cent to 1.37 cents higher with april at 72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to .85 cent higher with march at 81 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .42 cent higher with april at 43.72 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75 cent lower to .25 cent higher with march at 53.95 cents a pound
grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the chicago board of trade with wheat and corn finishing lower while soybeans advanced
the substantial losses in wheat were due to heavy speculative selling linked to a lack of major new export business, analysts said

most energy futures prices rose slightly on the new york mercantile exchange in response to calls for meetings among oil-producing nations, analysts said
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 15 cents higher with april at $15.45 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to .19 cent higher with april at 43.49 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .23 cent lower to .41 cent higher with april at 43.71 cents a gallon
stock-index futures advanced slightly on the chicago mercantile exchange, where the contract for march delivery of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 269.10. the underlying spot index closed 2.05 points higher at 269.43
stocks rose strongly tuesday in a rally powered by takeover speculation, dividend-related buying and increased interest in blue chips, sending the dow jones average to its highest finish since the october crash
the closely watched average of 30 industrial stocks, which had been lagging behind the broader market recently, finished at 2,081.07, up 24.70, the best post-crash close since 2,071.62 on feb. 29. other market indices also advanced
wall street analysts said the rally partly reflected a desire by managers of institutional investment funds to put unused money to work, especially because the first quarter is drawing to a close in three weeks and the best-possible portfolios must be presented to clients
we're coming into show-and-tell time, the window-dressing period,'' said lawrence wachtel, an analyst at prudential bache securities inc. ``these guys can't sit there with piles of cash in a boiling market and not get called down by the people who pay them to manage money.''
others said the increased interest in stocks reflected true buying interest and waning anxiety by investors over the impact of the oct. 19 collapse, along with indications that the economy is thriving
as we move further away from the october break, more people have thrown away their bear market caps and put bull market caps on,'' said joseph barthel, technical trading strategist at the butcher &amp; singer inc. investment firm
others agreed that the potential for a stronger rally exists and some predicted the dow jones industrials would soon surpass the 2,100 barrier, but many professional strategists were reluctant to declare that the underlying post-crash nervousness has evaporated
we're still in that bear market mentality,'' said hank striefler, senior vice president on the trading floor at shearson lehman hutton inc. ``we haven't moved over that hump.''

mark peabody didn't crack a smile as the vice chairman of ford motor co., surrounded by cameras and microphones, leaned across the assembly line to hand him a check in an envelope
i was kind of nervous _ all those tv cameras,'' he said after harold poling chatted with him and gave him the check, peabody's share of ford's industry-record $4.6 billion in 1987 profits
on tuesday, ford distributed $653 million in profit-sharing checks averaging more than $3,700 to 156,479 hourly and salaried workers _ a record in profit-sharing for any u.s. corporation
most checks were distributed earlier in the day, but peabody and his pals on the main transmission assembly line at ford's livonia transmission plant agreed to wait until poling could distribute their checks in a ceremony recorded for posterity
it's not only the politicians who can call this super tuesday,'' poling told a crowd of cheering workers, adding that the plant's 4,500 employees received $17.6 million, or an average of $4,450 each
the livonia transmission workers' checks were higher than the company average because the workers have high seniority and the work force at the plant has remained stable for the past few years, said peter pestillo, vice president for employee and external affairs
workers on peabody's line assemble transmissions for front-wheel-drive cars such as the popular taurus-sable and the new lincoln continental. most of them, peabody included, said they are lucky to be there at all
most were on layoff from other plants and had enough seniority to be called to work at livonia when ford added the line three years ago
more than 160,250 ford workers in the united states received previous record profit-sharing checks averaging $2,100 for 1986, when ford earned $3.29 billion
ford workers took home an average $2,100 in profit-sharing for 1985, $2,000 for 1984 and $400 for 1983, when the company distributed the first checks
in the past five years, ford said it has given out more than $1.6 billion to its workers
general motors corp. workers received no share of gm's $3.56 billion in 1987 profits at the same time that the corporation said it would distribute $184.6 million in stock bonuses to executives
gm workers also received no 1986 profit-sharing, although executives received millions of dollars in cash and stock bonuses, angering gm workers heading into national contract negotiations
gm, the nation's largest automaker, switched to the ford profit-sharing formula for 1988, but the company said that formula still would have generated no profit-sharing had it been used for 1987
marks and spencer plc, britain's most profitable retailer, said tuesday it signed an agreement to purchase the swank u.s. clothing chain brooks brothers from canada's campeau corp. for $770 million
but it reiterated that the brooks brothers purchase is conditional on the success of campeau's $6.18 billion cash bid for federated department stores inc., which is being contested by r.h. macy &amp; co
marks and spencer agreed to pay $720 million for brooks brothers itself and for preferential rights to lease space in the enlarged 800-strong campeau stores empire
the purchase price also included $50 million in exchange for campeau's pledge not to set up a speciality menswear chain in the next five years that would compete with brooks brothers in japan or the united states. marks.</note>
the dollar continued to slide tuesday as the british pound again soared and other major currencies took their cue from sterling
gold prices were mixed. republic national bank of new york quoted a bid price of $435.70 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. est, down from $436.80 late monday
analysts said the british currency was buoyed by high interest rates and the strength of the country's economy
prime minister margaret thatcher ruled out an early cut in interest rates, giving the pound a further boost tuesday. she told parliament a drop in rates ``would not be in the interest of inflation at the present time.''
robert ryan, a senior currency trader at irving trust co., said ``interest rates across the board seem to be ruling the markets right now,'' with the currencies of countries with higher yields _ such as the pound _ turning in the best performances
sterling rose to $1.8415 from $1.8135 late monday in london. in later new york trading, the pound rose to $1.8425 from $1.8180 late monday. the pound has gained nearly 7 cents against the dollar in two days
the dollar also continued under pressure because of signals that the u.s. economy is strong, analysts said
last friday's labor department report that the unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent in january convinced traders that the economy is healthier than had been expected
the market believed the economy ``could maintain demand for stronger imports and keep the u.s. trade deficit wide,'' said gary dorsch, a market analyst with lns financial group in chicago
dorsch predicted the dollar could fall toward 165 west german marks before there is central bank intervention to support the u.s. currency
the dollar traded at 1.6668 marks in europe, down from 1.6765 late monday. in new york, the dollar was quoted at 1.6673 marks, down from 1.6771 late monday

investors also appeared to be buying shares deemed to be at bargain prices after the tokyo market's decline on tuesday, dealers said. not work on academy awards show, meeting with mediator breaks off until wednesday. picks up 7th graf pvs, `there were...'.</note>
officials of the writers guild of america's western unit voted unanimously tuesday not to allow guild members to write for the academy awards show scheduled for next month
the producers of the academy awards had asked that the guild allow the writers to continue working on the show
the board of directors of the writers guild of america west voted unanimously this evening to deny the request for waiver from the academy of motion picture arts and science for the academy awards ceremonies,'' said guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden
what that means is that writers guild writers will not be writing the academy awards ceremonies,'' ms. rhoden added
the strike by 9,000 members of the writers guild of america against the alliance of motion picture and television producers began monday, a week after their contract expired
bob werden, spokesman for the academy of motion picture arts and sciences, had said earlier tuesday that the academy had asked for the waiver. in past strikes, entertainment unions have usually granted waivers for the oscars
without the waiver, ``we'll struggle on somehow,'' he had said
scriptwriter mel shavelson, former wga president, and another union member, jack rose, were hired by the academy to write the program, which is scheduled to be televised worldwide by abc-tv on april 11
if there is no waiver, i won't do the show,'' shavelson said tuesday, adding the writing was far from complete. ``most of the work is done when the cast shows up at rehearsal. it's rewriting, really
if there is no waiver, you will find out how good actors are at ad-libbing,'' he said. in general, writers provide most material for the hosts and presenters at the ceremony; the winners' thanks are their own
meanwhile, a federal mediator brought together negotiators for 9,000 striking scriptwriters and entertainment producers tuesday to outline differences in a walkout the union says could cripple hollywood
bargainers for the writers and the producers began meeting at midday with commissioner leonard farrell of the federal mediation and conciliation service
in the early evening the meeting was recessed until 11 a.m. thursday
both sides outlined differences and issues, but no bargaining was conducted, said alliance spokesman herb steinberg. sticking points were writers' demands for increased fees and creative rights
the final offer by producers was rejected by the guild sunday and talks broke off. no new bargaining sessions were scheduled
about 2,000 pickets gathered monday outside 20th century fox studios. meanwhile, producers urged writers to defy the picket lines and said temporary replacements may be hired
there were no large picket line demonstrations tuesday
as the writers marched, alliance president and chief negotiator nick counter said producers may begin hiring temporary replacements for striking writers until a settlement was reached
our companies are encouraging whoever wants to come forward to write these scripts,'' he said, urging union and non-union writers to cross picket lines
counter said non-guild writers were being sought to keep soap operas afloat and to keep the wheels turning on hollywood's game show circuit
while the writer's guild said talk shows and soap operas would be the first to feel the effects of the strike, probably turning to reruns, the producers said other shows had stockpiled scripts
the wga strike is the fourth since a 17-week walkout in 1973. the longest, in 1981, lasted three months
it's the same kind of feeling as we had in 1981,'' counter said, predicting the strike may be an extended one. ``this could go on even longer than that.''
speaking for the producers, steinberg said: ``we feel all the issues were dealt with fairly. they went on strike on issues we felt were resolved.'' he added that producers were ``ready to write a check for $550 million'' for a new three-year contract. the alliance represents about 200 producers and studios.
