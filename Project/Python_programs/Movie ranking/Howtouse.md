This Python script fetches and parses the weekly box office ranking from a specified URL using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. Here’s a detailed explanation of its functionality:

Import Libraries:

requests is used to make HTTP requests to retrieve the webpage content.
BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library is used for parsing the HTML content of the webpage.
Fetch Webpage Content:

The script sends a GET request to the URL 'https://movie.daum.net/ranking/boxoffice/weekly'.
It checks if the request was successful by verifying if the HTTP status code is 200.
Parse HTML Content:

If the request is successful, it uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the webpage.
Extract Movie Information:

It finds all div elements with the class thumb_cont, which contain the movie information.
It iterates through the first five of these div elements (since we only want the top 5 movies) and extracts the relevant details:
Rank: Determined by the position in the iteration.
Title: Extracted from the strong element with the class tit_item.
Release Date: Extracted from the span element with the class txt_info, specifically from its child span with the class txt_num.
Audience Count: Extracted from the span element that contains the string "관객수", and then from its next sibling element.
Print Movie Information:

It prints the rank, title, release date, and cumulative audience count for the top 5 movies in a formatted output.
Error Handling:

If the request to fetch the webpage fails, it prints an error message indicating the failure.
Here is a code snippet for the described functionality:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://movie.daum.net/ranking/boxoffice/weekly'

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Extract all ranking elements containing movie information
    divs = soup.find_all('div', class_='thumb_cont')

    # Print top 5 movies
    print('[Weekly Box Office Rankings from 1st to 5th]\n')
    for i, div in enumerate(divs[:5], start=1):
        rank = i
        title = div.find('strong', class_='tit_item').text.strip()

        info_txt = div.find('span', class_='txt_info')
        release_date = info_txt.find('span', class_='txt_num').text.strip()
        
        audience_span = div.find('span', string='관객수')
        audience = audience_span.find_next_sibling(string=True).strip().replace('명', '')
        
        print(f'{rank}위: {title}\t(Release Date: {release_date})\n     (Cumulative Audience: {audience})\n')
else:
    print('Request failed.')
This script provides a structured way to fetch and display the weekly box office rankings, presenting the title, release date, and audience count for the top 5 movies.
